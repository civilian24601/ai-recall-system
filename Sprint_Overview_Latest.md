# **AI Recall System – Hyper Sprint Overview**

## 1. Sprint Context

You started a **three-week hyper sprint** to bring the project to an MVP / PoC state.  
- **Week 1** was mostly about setting up core logging, ChromaDB, and initial AI workflows.  
- **Week 2** progressed into threshold logic, blueprint execution logs, basic debugging recall, and code retrieval.  
- **Week 3** was meant for finalizing automated indexing (chunking / embedding the entire codebase), advanced testing, and ensuring the AI can recall + fix real code issues.

However, ChatGPT conversation issues interrupted your workflow, leaving the plan partially derailed. You then spent time **cleaning up** project files, merging older docs, and re-verifying each script’s purpose.

## 2. Current Status

- **Unified Project Files**: You have reorganized / archived older scripts, updated `.md` docs, and consolidated them into a single knowledge_base folder.  
- **ChromaDB** is in place, with some logs and partial code indexing.  
- **Blueprint Execution** and **Debugging Logic** are functioning for single-agent tasks, logging, and threshold-based revision triggers.  
- **Testing** includes `test_blueprint_execution.py`, `test_agent_manager.py`, etc., which pass in a local environment.

You **intend** to pick up the final pieces of the sprint: chunking/indexing the entire codebase, ensuring real-time or near-real-time updates, and possibly letting the AI do more automatic debugging or code improvements.

## 3. Action Plan to Resume the Sprint

Here’s how you can get back on track:

### 3.1 Revisit the MVP Definition

- **MVP Goal**: An AI that can:
  1. **Index** the entire codebase in Chroma (code + knowledge docs),
  2. **Recall** relevant code / logs / past fixes when a new bug or request arises,
  3. **Suggest** solutions or improvements (with some partial automation).

Check if you still agree with this scope for the **end of Week 3** or if you want to adjust.

### 3.2 Finalize Code Indexing & Chunking

1. **Script**: Decide on a single script or a couple of watchers to chunk / embed all `.py`, `.md`, etc.  
2. **Metadata**: Attach filename, line ranges, function names to each chunk for better retrieval.  
3. **Periodic Refresh**: Possibly run it daily or on commit to keep the index fresh.

**Outcome**: The AI can do real-time queries like “Which function references zero-division errors?” or “Where did we fix a 502 error?” and instantly find relevant code.

### 3.3 Strengthen AI Retrieval Flow

- **Before** AI suggests any new solution, have it query the codebase with your aggregator or direct Chroma calls.  
- Combine that with the existing blueprint logic so that the improvement notes or revision proposals reference real code lines, not just logs.  
- This is key for making the AI’s suggestions more specific and meaningful.

### 3.4 Expand Testing to Reflect Full Code Context

- Add or update tests in `test_query_chroma.py` or new ones to confirm that chunking is robust and the AI can retrieve the right code snippets.  
- Possibly do an integration test where you intentionally create a bug, the AI indexes the code, and verifies it can propose a known fix.

### 3.5 Evaluate Next Steps for Self-Debugging

- If time permits, let the blueprint execution or debugging logic actually **apply** fixes to a test file in a dev branch.  
- For instance, the AI might generate a patch for a known bug. You run tests. If tests pass, you accept the patch. If not, revert.

## 4. Reconfirm the “Memory Palace” Vision

This indexing approach is the fundamental piece for your “Memory Palace–level recall.” Once all code + logs are chunked, you can:

- Seamlessly reference old solutions from any project,
- Potentially unify them in a global knowledge base if you have multiple repos,
- Move toward a multi-agent scenario where specialized agents (Engineer, QA, etc.) gather relevant code snippets or past fixes automatically.

### 4.1 Self-Building Potential

You’ve already seen how the AI could eventually “rewrite” or “refactor” its own code. This pivot from a single-agent recall system to a multi-agent, self-improving environment is **exactly** where your MVP can grow **after** you finalize the code indexing + chunking pipeline.

## 5. Is This Exciting? Absolutely

- You’re not far from an MVP that can reliably reference any code snippet or debug log in real time.  
- The final sprint tasks revolve around bridging all your partial solutions (logging, blueprint triggers, debugging flows, code indexing) into a single cohesive pipeline.  
- It’s a large step, but once done, you can test advanced scenarios like “AI sees a function has a zero-division risk, references a fix from a prior script, and modifies the code automatically.”

## 6. Sprint Summary Checklist

**Below is a brief bullet list** for how to spend the remainder of your sprint:

1. **Finish Code Indexing**  
   - Implement or refine `index_codebase.py` with robust chunking and watchers if desired.  
   - Check performance on your local repository size.

2. **Enhance AI Retrieval**  
   - Ensure aggregator_search or direct Chroma queries can pull code snippet metadata.  
   - Confirm existing scripts (blueprint_execution.py, debugging_strategy.py) can call these queries when generating improvement suggestions.

3. **Integrate Testing**  
   - Expand tests to confirm code retrieval queries are returning correct line references.  
   - Possibly create a new test_xxx.py that simulates a code error + fix retrieval + blueprint revision cycle.

4. **(Optional) Partial Self-Fix**  
   - If time allows, let the system attempt a small fix on a dev file.  
   - Insert a known error or un-optimized snippet, watch the AI find it, fix it, and store the outcome in logs.

5. **Document**  
   - Log your final approach in `knowledge_base/` so your AI can see how chunking and watchers were implemented.  
   - Summarize this approach in your daily or weekly summary logs for future reference.

**That’s it**. With these steps, you’ll pick up exactly where you left off, complete your 3-week hyper sprint to an MVP, and get one major leap closer to the fully realized “AI memory palace” system you originally envisioned. Good luck!
