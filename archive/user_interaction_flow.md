# 🧑‍💻 User Interaction Flow - AI Recall System

## **📌 Overview**

**This document outlines how the AI Recall System interacts with both human developers and autonomous AI workflows**.  

🚀 **Current State:**  

- **Developers interact via CLI and API requests**  
- **AI assists with code retrieval, debugging recall, and structured work memory**  

🌍 **Future Goal:**  

- **AI self-queries past solutions automatically**  
- **AI autonomously retrieves debugging logs & executes self-fixes**  
- **Human oversight is reserved for validation & creativity, not manual recall**  

✅ **Access Points for Interaction:**  

- **CLI Commands → Manual retrieval of past knowledge & debugging logs**  
- **AI-to-AI Querying (Future) → AI autonomously queries & applies past knowledge**

## **📌 Current Human-to-AI Workflows (Manual Interactions)**

📌 **Today, developers interact with the system using:**  

| **Method** | **Description** |
|------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **CLI Commands** | Manually retrieve knowledge & debug history. |
| **Continue.dev AI Chat** | Ask AI for coding help inside VS Code.(phasing out) |
| **API Endpoints** | Query stored knowledge for external integrations. |

📌 **Example CLI Usage**

```bash
ai-recall "How did we solve API rate limiting?"
✅ Retrieves past solutions from ChromaDB

📌 Future AI-to-AI Workflow (Autonomous Queries)
📌 As the system evolves, AI will automatically handle recall & debugging.

Process Future AI Behavior
Self-Querying Past Work AI autonomously checks past debugging logs before proposing fixes.
Code Improvement Suggestions AI proactively recommends optimizations based on stored best practices.
Self-Triage of Issues AI detects errors and retrieves past solutions before executing a fix.
📌 Example AI Behavior (Future) 🚀 Instead of the developer typing:


ai-debug "What was the last database error?"
✅ The AI will autonomously run the same query, fetch results, and apply a fix without human intervention.

📌 Continue.dev - AI-Assisted Coding in VS Code
📌 Currently, developers manually query AI for suggestions.
📌 Eventually, the AI will use Continue.dev APIs to self-optimize codebases.

Feature Current Use Future AI Behavior
@codebase Manually retrieve code snippets AI auto-searches relevant project files
@docs Pull documentation manually AI references docs before executing fixes
AI Chat Direct human interaction AI-to-AI querying for workflow automation
📌 Future AI Workflow Example 1️⃣ AI encounters an error in api_structure.py
2️⃣ AI queries debugging logs autonomously
3️⃣ AI retrieves and applies the previous fix
4️⃣ AI validates that the issue is resolved before deployment

✅ Reduces human intervention in debugging cycles.

📌 API-Assisted AI Interaction
📌 Currently, API endpoints allow external tools to interact with the AI Recall System.
📌 In the future, AI will self-query these endpoints automatically.

🔹 Query Stored Knowledge (/query/knowledge)
Method: POST
Example Request:

{
    "query": "What debugging steps were used for the last API failure?"
}
Example Response:

json
Copy
Edit
{
    "retrieved_knowledge": "The last API failure was related to a missing API key. Debugging steps included..."
}
✅ AI will eventually call this endpoint autonomously during error handling.

📌 Summary
📌 This document ensures developers can efficiently interact with AI for:
✅ Current Manual Workflows (CLI, Continue.dev, API queries)
✅ Future AI-to-AI Workflows (Autonomous debugging, self-querying memory)
✅ Seamless evolution from human-AI interaction to full AI-driven execution
