# 🛤️ AI Recall System - Roadmap

## **📌 Overview**

This roadmap outlines the **phased development of the AI Recall System**, progressing from **manual AI-assisted recall to fully autonomous AI-driven workflows**.  

🚀 **Current Status:** **Single-Agent AI Recall (Phase 1 in Progress)**  
📌 **Next Steps:** AI **automates recall & debugging workflows before expanding to multi-agent mode**  

---

## **📌 Phase 1: Core AI Recall & Debugging Memory (0-3 Months)**

📌 **Goal:** Ensure AI can **retrieve knowledge, recall debugging steps, and assist in fixing errors.**  

### **🔹 1. Key Milestones**

✅ **ChromaDB Fully Integrated for AI Recall**  
✅ **AI Debugging Logs Implemented & Queryable**  
✅ **Work Session Tracking & Recall Operational**  

### **🔹 1. Dependencies**

- ChromaDB indexing for past debugging sessions.  
- CLI tools (`ai-recall`, `ai-debug`) functional.  
- API endpoints (`/query/knowledge`, `/query/debug`) fully tested.  

### **✅ 1. Validation Criteria**

- AI **retrieves past debugging logs** within **5 seconds**.  
- AI recall accuracy is **≥85% relevant to current tasks**.  
- **Debugging suggestions are based on stored ChromaDB knowledge**.

## **📌 Phase 2: AI Self-Debugging & Optimization (3-6 Months)**

📌 **Goal:** AI **automatically retrieves relevant debugging logs & suggests fixes** before human intervention is required.  

### **🔹 2. Key Milestones**

✅ **AI Pre-Fetches Debugging Logs Automatically**  
✅ **AI Detects Errors & Queries Past Fixes Without Human Input**  
✅ **AI Suggests Code Optimizations Based on Past Patterns**  

### **🔹 2. Dependencies**

- AI monitoring of error logs (`debug_logs.json`).  
- Automated API calls to `ai-debug` upon error detection.  
- AI self-assessment pipeline for evaluating retrieval success.  

### **✅ 2. Validation Criteria**

- AI correctly **predicts & retrieves the last known debugging solution** in **≥90% of cases**.  
- Debugging recall workflow **reduces human error resolution time by 50%**.  
- AI-assisted debugging passes **unit tests on past logged errors**.

## **📌 Phase 3: AI Self-Writing & Code Improvement (6-9 Months)**

📌 **Goal:** AI begins **refactoring inefficient code**, self-generating improvements, and tracking development cycles.  

### **🔹 3. Key Milestones**

✅ **AI Identifies Redundant & Inefficient Code**  
✅ **AI Recommends Improvements & Justifies Changes**  
✅ **AI Logs & Evaluates Its Own Code Modifications**  

### **🔹 3. Dependencies**

- AI ability to compare **current vs. past code performance**.  
- Testing framework for **verifying AI-generated improvements**.  
- Continue.dev API integration for **AI-guided refactoring suggestions**.  

### **✅ 3. Validation Criteria**

- AI **identifies inefficiencies** in at least **70% of analyzed code**.  
- AI-generated refactors pass **unit tests without regression failures**.  
- **Human validation required only for high-risk modifications**.

## **📌 Phase 4: Multi-Agent Expansion & Full Autonomy (9-12 Months)**

📌 **Goal:** Transition from **single-agent recall to fully autonomous AI collaboration**.  

### **🔹 4. Key Milestones**

✅ **Engineer, Debugger, and Oversight Agents Active**  
✅ **Agents Collaborate for Self-Improving Workflows**  
✅ **System Requires Minimal Human Supervision**  

### **🔹 4. Dependencies**

- Successful transition from **passive AI recall to AI-initiated execution**.  
- Automated system validation for AI self-generated solutions.  
- Modular agent design allowing specialization in different development tasks.  

### **✅ 4. Validation Criteria**

- AI teams **successfully execute a full debugging + refactoring cycle** without human intervention.  
- **Autonomous execution success rate exceeds 95% for non-critical features**.  
- AI oversight agent flags **critical failures with high accuracy**.  

---

## **📌 Final Goal: AI-Driven Software Engineering (12+ Months)**

📌 **The AI Recall System evolves into a fully autonomous AI development entity, capable of:**  
✅ **Self-debugging & self-repair**  
✅ **Writing & optimizing its own code**  
✅ **Cross-project AI recall & collaboration**  

🚀 **The human role shifts to high-level oversight, strategic decision-making, and guiding AI expansion.**
