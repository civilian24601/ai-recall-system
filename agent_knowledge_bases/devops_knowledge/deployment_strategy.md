## 1. Containerization
- Dockerfile setup for packaging the AI API.
- Base image: Python 3.10 with Flask and Gunicorn.

## 2. Scaling
- Kubernetes or Docker Swarm for container orchestration.
- Load balancer to distribute API requests across instances.

## 3. Monitoring & Logging
- Use Prometheus and Grafana for system health tracking.
- Log structured outputs to a database.

## 4. Security
- API Key authentication.
- Rate limiting with Nginx or Cloudflare.

## 5. CI/CD Pipeline
- GitHub Actions or Jenkins for automated deployments.
- Auto-build on feature completion.
