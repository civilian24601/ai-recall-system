# Week 3 Updated Sprint Schedule

## Day-by-Day Overview

### **Monday (Today)**

**Goal**: High-level system check & environment readiness

1. **System-Wide Smoke Tests**
    - **Blueprint Execution**: Confirm your blueprint logging & revision proposal logic still runs. Manually trigger a blueprint log entry (via `blueprint_execution.py`) and verify it appears in Chroma.
    - **Debugging Logic**: Run a minimal debugging query (e.g., `ai-debug "Show last 3 debugging sessions."`) to ensure it retrieves from the correct `debug_logs` collection.
    - **Work Session Logging**: Log a new session with `log_work_session.py` or `work_session_logger.py`, then confirm it’s appended to `work_session.md` and inserted into the `work_sessions` Chroma collection.
    - **Index & Retrieval**:
        - Re-run `index_codebase.py` on a small subset or your entire code to confirm new or changed files are recognized.
        - Test aggregator or code snippet retrieval with `aggregator_search.py` or `retrieve_codebase.py` (embedding-based).
    - **Daily Summaries**: If you rely on `generate_work_summary.py` or a daily script, do a quick check that it runs without error, generating a `.md` or `.json` summary.
2. **Document Observations**
    - If anything breaks, note exactly the error or mismatch. We’ll fix or finalize these issues before proceeding.
    - This helps you see which components are stable enough to move forward.
3. **Plan Testing Approach**
    - Begin drafting a list or structure (maybe a new `.md` doc) of the test scenarios you want to implement. We’ll flesh them out tomorrow, but start enumerating typical usage flows and edge cases.

### **Tuesday**

**Goal**: Formalize & implement your expanded testing plan

1. **Define the Master Test Matrix**
    - **Unit Tests**: For scripts like `blueprint_execution.py`, `debugging_strategy.py`, `work_session_logger.py`.
    - **Integration Tests**: For multi-step flows (e.g., index code → aggregator search → use debugging logs).
    - **Edge Cases**: Very large logs, missing logs, repeated sub-threshold fails, concurrency issues, etc.
    - **AI Autonomy Safety**: Failing partial tasks, blueprint meltdown triggers, etc.
2. **Implement or Update Test Scripts**
    - Expand what you have in `tests/` to cover newly enumerated scenarios.
    - Possibly create or unify “mock” data (like a small set of debug logs or code files) to systematically test each flow.
    - Generate a “test scenario doc” that outlines the scenario, the expected output, and what the system should do if something goes wrong.
3. **Auto-Suggested Tests**
    - Brainstorm how the AI might propose new tests. For example:
        - A function that looks at all logs for top error categories and automatically writes new test stubs.
        - A script that compares coverage vs. known flows and suggests test expansions.

### **Wednesday**

**Goal**: Start exploring partial autonomy in a controlled dev environment, plus set up GitHub

1. **Set Up a GitHub Repo**
    - If you haven’t already, push your entire codebase to a private or public GitHub repo.
    - Make sure you have a clear `.gitignore` for logs, `chroma_db`, etc.
2. **Autonomy in a Sandbox**
    - Create a “dev” or “sandbox” branch.
    - Let the AI do small tasks—e.g., see if the AI can auto-fix a trivial bug or auto-generate a doc.
    - Merge only after you manually review.
    - Evaluate how well your blueprint logs or debugging strategies help the AI produce safe changes.
3. **Testing Integration**
    - Possibly integrate a basic CI workflow on GitHub (e.g., GitHub Actions) that runs your new tests each push or PR.
    - This ensures test coverage is always validated before merging.

### **Thursday**

**Goal**: Strengthen the autonomy approach and finalize test coverage for the main features

1. **Refine the AI Dev Flow**
    - If the AI is going to propose code changes (like in a multi-agent scenario), define the review pipeline.
    - For example: “Proposed fix → run test suite → if all pass, open a PR → final manual check.”
2. **Expand Test Suites**
    - Incorporate new scenarios that your system or the AI proposed.
    - Validate them in a real environment. Possibly do performance tests on aggregator_search or large logs.
3. **Stabilize**
    - If you found any issues in the earlier days, fix them now and confirm each fix.
    - This day is about iterative improvements so that by Friday, everything is rock-solid.

### **Friday**

**Goal**: Wrap up the sprint deliverables, do a final sign-off on readiness for next steps

1. **Sprint Summary**
    - Summarize which tests are in place, which are passing.
    - Summarize partial autonomy achievements (like “AI can fix basic code errors via dev branch”).
2. **Documentation**
    - Document your workflow: how to run tests, how to set up a new environment, how to add logs.
    - Update relevant `.md` files so new contributors or your future self know where everything stands.
3. **Preview Next Steps**
    - Outline that “basic chat UI” or more advanced UI with Flask + LM Studio as the star of the next sprint. Possibly gather a short requirements doc or wireframe if time remains.

### **Monday (Next Week)**

**Goal**: Final checks, final merges, and pick final backlog items for the last day

1. **Bug Bash**
    - Re-run the entire test suite.
    - Fix any flakiness.
    - Ensure stable `main` or `master` branch so you can say “We are production-ready for the next sprint’s UI.”
2. **Optionally** do a quick-lift “Chat UI” skeleton if you have leftover capacity. Or, at least plan it thoroughly so Tuesday can be about implementing or refining it.

### **Tuesday (Sprint Conclusion)**

**Goal**: Official sprint close, plus final demonstration or recap

1. **Demo** everything you have done:
    - Show how you run tests,
    - Show how the partial autonomy flow works in the dev branch,
    - Show the blueprint logs & debug logs in action.
2. **Sprint Retrospective**:
    - See what worked, what didn’t, what’s next.
    - Decide if the chat UI is definitely the next chief feature or if there’s something more pressing (like further autonomy or packaging).

## Additional Notes & Recommendations

1. **Testing Is Foundational**
    - Your plan to treat testing as a “built-in approach” is spot-on. Ensuring each system step has coverage now will let future expansions (like the chat UI or multi-agent autonomy) land on stable ground.
2. **Data Volume & Performance**
    - If your logs or code indexes are large, you might do stress tests or confirm indexing performance. Not strictly necessary for the sprint, but worth noting.
3. **Don’t Overcommit**
    - If you run out of time, prioritize finalizing the test coverage and partial autonomy flow. A chat UI can be the next sprint’s big push once the underpinnings are proven stable.

### Final Word

Following the above daily breakdown helps you:

- **Verify** your existing system thoroughly,
- **Build** an extensive test suite,
- **Begin** a safe, partial autonomy pipeline,
- **Adopt** version control with GitHub to track everything,
- **End** the sprint with a stable foundation so you can **tackle the “chat UI”** or deeper features next.
