---

### **✅ Task 3: Debugging Recall & Self-Tracking System**

**Objective:** Build **self-tracking debugging logs** to ensure the system remembers past failures & fixes.

📌 **Expected Output:**

- [ ]  A **`debug_report.md`** that logs system errors and past fixes
- [ ]  AI **remembers previous errors & fixes before suggesting new solutions**
- [ ]  Ensure debugging logs are **separated by project**

**Testing Criteria:**

- [ ]  Simulate an **error log entry** and verify it is properly stored
- [ ]  Ensure AI can **suggest past debugging fixes when errors occur**
- [ ]  AI must **retrieve past debugging context in under 5 seconds**

---

### **✅ Task 4: Implement Work Session Logs & AI Recall**

**Objective:** Ensure **the AI logs work progress** and allows quick recall of past actions.

📌 **Expected Output:**

- [ ]  Work sessions logged **at multiple intervals (30m, 2h, 5h, etc.)**
- [ ]  Ability to retrieve **context-aware summaries of past work**
- [ ]  AI has a clear log of **all work interactions**

**Testing Criteria:**

- [ ]  Generate **sample work logs for different intervals**
- [ ]  Ensure AI can retrieve **a specific past log entry within seconds**
- [ ]  AI must **accurately summarize past work in 3 sentences**

---

### **📌 Week 1 Exit Criteria**

✅ We have a **fully functional AI recall system** (logs past work, debugging history, and solutions)

✅ AI can **retrieve and reference past debugging attempts automatically**

✅ **Work session logs** exist and are **queryable by different time intervals**

✅ The system is **ready to integrate into ChromaDB in Week 2**

---

# **📌 Week 2: Implement Self-Improving ChromaDB Integration**

## **🎯 Goals**

1️⃣ Ensure **knowledge base & debugging logs mirror into ChromaDB**

2️⃣ Automate **knowledge updates & revision tracking**

3️⃣ **Allow AI to intelligently retrieve cross-project knowledge**

4️⃣ **Test retrieval efficiency** to ensure AI can use its memory properly

---

## **📌 Checklist for Week 2**

### **✅ Task 1: Integrate `knowledge_base/` with ChromaDB**

**Objective:** Ensure all `.md` files are automatically indexed in **local + global ChromaDB storage**.

📌 **Expected Output:**

- [ ]  **All project `.md` files are stored & retrievable in ChromaDB**
- [ ]  **Mirroring system updates global knowledge base automatically**

**Testing Criteria:**

- [ ]  Confirm **each file update triggers an automatic ChromaDB update**
- [ ]  Ensure retrieval **accurately recalls past documentation**

---

### **✅ Task 2: Implement Codebase Indexing in ChromaDB**

**Objective:** Enable **codebase indexing**, allowing AI to track function headers, scripts, and past modifications.

📌 **Expected Output:**

- [ ]  **Codebase structure is mirrored into ChromaDB for AI recall**
- [ ]  **Functions, classes, and docstrings are stored in vector format**

**Testing Criteria:**

- [ ]  AI must retrieve **a function definition from another project**
- [ ]  AI can **suggest relevant past implementations based on context**

---

### **📌 Week 2 Exit Criteria**

✅ ChromaDB **contains all `.md` files & debugging logs**

✅ AI **retrieves past knowledge correctly**

✅ AI **remembers past work & debugging history from ChromaDB**

# **📌 Week 3: Self-Evaluating AI & Future Expansion Prep**

## **🎯 Goals**

1️⃣ AI can **autonomously evaluate its own memory & suggest improvements**

2️⃣ AI logs **which retrievals were helpful or misleading**

3️⃣ System is **prepared for multi-agent return**

---

## **📌 Checklist for Week 3**

### **✅ Task 1: Implement AI Self-Evaluation of Stored Knowledge**

**Objective:** Ensure AI can **reflect on its stored memory** and adjust its recall strategy.

📌 **Expected Output:**

- [ ]  AI **ranks past retrievals as “useful” or “misleading”**
- [ ]  AI suggests **which logs or entries need improvement**

**Testing Criteria:**

- [ ]  AI must **identify at least one outdated log and suggest an update**
- [ ]  AI should **flag conflicting or redundant entries**

---

### **✅ Task 2: Prepare for Multi-Agent Expansion**

**Objective:** Once self-evaluation works, ensure system can **scale back into multi-agent mode.**

📌 **Expected Output:**
