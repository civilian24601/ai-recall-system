# 🏗️ Core Architecture - AI Recall System

## **📌 Overview**

The AI Recall System is a **self-improving AI-powered development assistant** that evolves from **manual AI-assisted recall to fully autonomous debugging and execution workflows.**  

✅ **Primary Capabilities:**  

- **AI Knowledge Recall** → AI retrieves past work, debugging logs, and solutions from ChromaDB.  
- **Self-Debugging & Execution** → AI detects errors, retrieves past fixes, and applies solutions automatically.  
- **Autonomous Code Generation** → AI iterates on code improvements with minimal human input.  
- **Multi-Agent Collaboration (Future)** → AI teams work together to optimize and execute development workflows.  

🚀 **Current Status:** **Single-Agent Mode (AI Recall & Debugging) in Progress**  
📌 **Next Step:** AI **automates self-debugging before expanding into Multi-Agent workflows.**

## **📌 System Components**

| **Component** | **Purpose** |
|--------------|------------|
| **Flask API (`api_structure.py`)** | Routes AI queries, model execution, and debugging requests. |
| **LM Studio (Local Models)** | Executes AI-generated prompts & suggestions. |
| **ChromaDB (`chroma_db/`)** | Stores vector embeddings of past AI work for retrieval. |
| **Continue.dev (VS Code AI Assistant)** | Enhances real-time AI-powered development. |
| **CLI Commands (`ai-recall`, `ai-debug`)** | Enables manual AI-assisted debugging and recall. |
| **Knowledge Base (`knowledge_base/`)** | Stores documentation, architecture notes, and debugging history. |

✅ **AI is trained to self-query these components to solve problems autonomously.**  

---

## **📌 Single-Agent Mode (Current State)**

📌 **The system currently operates in Single-Agent Mode, where:**  
✅ AI **retrieves past debugging logs, work summaries, and stored solutions.**  
✅ AI **assists in debugging but requires human execution of fixes.**  
✅ AI **does not yet refactor or apply fixes automatically.**  

🔹 **Current Workflow:**  
1️⃣ **User asks AI a recall question via CLI or Continue.dev.**  
2️⃣ AI **queries ChromaDB for relevant past work.**  
3️⃣ AI **suggests a solution based on prior debugging logs.**  
4️⃣ **User applies the fix manually and updates the knowledge base.**  

✅ **Knowledge is stored and retrieved, but AI execution is still manual.**  

---

## **📌 Multi-Agent Mode (Future Expansion)**

📌 **The AI Recall System is designed to scale into a Multi-Agent Framework.**  
🚀 **Goal:** AI will transition from **passive recall to active self-debugging, execution, and optimization.**  

### **🔹 Planned AI Agents**

| **Agent** | **Role** |
|-----------|---------|
| **Engineer Agent** | Writes, refactors, and improves AI-generated code. |
| **QA Agent** | Tests AI modifications for accuracy and consistency. |
| **Debug Agent** | Detects errors, retrieves past solutions, and applies fixes. |
| **Oversight Agent** | Monitors AI behavior, prevents errors, and manages ChromaDB. |
| **DevOps Agent** | Handles system monitoring, scaling, and infrastructure tasks. |

✅ **Final goal:** AI becomes a **self-improving autonomous development system.**

## **📌 AI Self-Debugging & Knowledge Storage**

📌 **AI will transition from manual debugging assistance to autonomous execution.**  

### **🔹 Current Debugging Process**

1️⃣ AI **logs debugging issues in `debug_logs.json`.**  
2️⃣ AI **retrieves past fixes from ChromaDB when prompted.**  
3️⃣ AI **suggests a solution, but the developer applies the fix manually.**  

### **🔹 Future Self-Debugging**

✅ AI **detects errors and queries past debugging solutions automatically.**  
✅ AI **applies the fix without human intervention (after verification).**  
✅ AI **evaluates success & logs whether the solution worked.**  

🚀 **Goal:** AI **closes its own debugging loops**, reducing human intervention.  

---

## **📌 AI Knowledge Flow (ChromaDB-Powered Recall)**

📌 **ChromaDB serves as AI’s persistent long-term memory.**  
✅ AI **automatically updates ChromaDB with debugging logs, past work, and solutions.**  
✅ AI **queries stored knowledge before generating new solutions.**  
✅ AI **retrieves project-specific knowledge to ensure contextual accuracy.**  

### **🔹 Knowledge Retrieval Workflow**

1️⃣ AI **searches ChromaDB before attempting to generate a solution.**  
2️⃣ AI **retrieves past work relevant to the current problem.**  
3️⃣ AI **compares stored solutions and ranks their effectiveness.**  
4️⃣ AI **selects the best prior fix and applies or modifies it as needed.** 
4️⃣ AI **if no prior fix is available, AI generates and tests new solution, logging the results**  

🚀 **Goal:** **AI should not first "reinvent the wheel"—it should recall and apply past solutions intelligently. If past solutions are inadequate or nonexistent, AI then flexes its agency and generates solutions to test and if successful and safe, implement.**  

---

🚀 **Future Goal:** AI will **self-query and apply fixes automatically without human input.**

## **📌 Future Goals & Milestones**

| **Phase** | **Goal** | **AI Capability** |
|----------|--------|------------------|
| **Phase 1: AI Recall & Debugging** | ✅ Store & retrieve past work. | **Passive recall only.** |
| **Phase 2: AI Self-Debugging** | ✅ AI applies past fixes automatically. | **Self-executing error resolution.** |
| **Phase 3: AI Self-Refactoring** | ✅ AI modifies & improves its own code. | **Autonomous optimization.** |
| **Phase 4: Fully Autonomous AI** | ✅ AI executes complete projects. | **Human oversight only.** |

🚀 **The final goal:** AI **becomes an autonomous self-improving development assistant.**
