# ðŸ“– AI Best Practices - AI Recall System  

## **ðŸ“Œ Overview**  

This document outlines the **best practices for AI-generated code, debugging recall, and workflow execution.**  

ðŸš€ **Primary Goals:**  
âœ… **Ensure AI follows structured, efficient development workflows**  
âœ… **Standardize AI-generated code for readability, reusability, and maintainability**  
âœ… **Optimize AI debugging recall & execution to prevent redundant problem-solving**  
âœ… **Ensure AI self-improves and executes solutions efficiently with robust safety and integrity checks**  

---

## **ðŸ“Œ 1. AI Code Generation Best Practices**  

ðŸ“Œ **All AI-generated code must follow structured, maintainable, and reusable formats.**  

### **ðŸ”¹ AI Code Formatting Standards**

âœ… **Use `snake_case` for variable and function names.**  
âœ… **Ensure all functions include a docstring with clear descriptions.**  
âœ… **Limit function complexityâ€”prefer small, modular functions.**  
âœ… **Avoid redundant logicâ€”AI must retrieve stored solutions before generating new code.**  

ðŸ“Œ **Example AI-Generated Code (Correct Format):**

```python
def fetch_recent_debug_logs(limit: int = 5) -> list:
    """
    Retrieves the most recent debugging logs from ChromaDB.

    Args:
        limit (int): Number of logs to retrieve.

    Returns:
        list: A list of debugging log entries.
    """
    logs = query_chroma_db("SELECT * FROM debug_logs ORDER BY timestamp DESC LIMIT ?", [limit])
    return logs
âœ… This ensures AI-generated code is structured, documented, and follows best practices.

ðŸ“Œ 2. AI Debugging & Execution Best Practices
ðŸ“Œ AI debugging recall & execution must follow structured retrieval and validation protocols.

ðŸ”¹ AI Debugging Workflow
âœ… Step 1: AI retrieves debugging logs before generating new fixes.
âœ… Step 2: AI prioritizes past solutions that were successfully applied.
âœ… Step 3: AI ranks solutions based on confidence and context relevance.
âœ… Step 4: AI suggests or applies the highest-confidence fix.

ðŸ“Œ Example AI Debugging Retrieval Execution:


ai-debug "Retrieve last 3 debugging sessions."
ðŸ”¹ AI Response Example:


[DEBUG LOG: 2025-02-10]
Error: SQL Integrity Constraint Violation
Fix Applied: Added unique constraint in schema.
Confidence Score: 98%
âœ… Prevents redundant debugging attempts and optimizes AI problem-solving efficiency.

ðŸ“Œ 3. AI Knowledge Retrieval & ChromaDB Best Practices
ðŸ“Œ AI retrieval logic must prioritize accuracy, context relevance, and structured storage.

ðŸ”¹ AI Query Execution Guidelines
âœ… AI must first check ChromaDB for previous solutions before generating new ones.
âœ… AI should rank retrieved solutions based on success rates and context similarity.
âœ… AI should log every retrieval attempt and its effectiveness for self-improvement.

ðŸ“Œ Example AI Knowledge Query Execution:


def retrieve_past_solution(query: str) -> list:
    """
    Queries ChromaDB for stored past solutions related to the given query.

    Args:
        query (str): Description of the issue.

    Returns:
        list: Retrieved solutions ranked by confidence score.
    """
    return query_chroma_db(f"SELECT solution FROM work_logs WHERE issue LIKE '%{query}%' ORDER BY confidence DESC LIMIT 3")
âœ… Ensures AI queries prioritize relevant, high-confidence solutions before proposing fixes.

## **ðŸ“Œ 4. AI Self-Refactoring & Code Optimization Best Practices**
## **ðŸ“Œ AI self-refactoring should be efficient, performance-aware, and prevent unnecessary complexity.**

### **ðŸ”¹ AI Code Optimization Workflow**
âœ… AI must compare past optimized code snippets before modifying existing code.
âœ… AI should refactor functions for efficiency without affecting core logic.
âœ… AI should validate refactored code against test cases before execution.

ðŸ“Œ Example AI Refactoring Validation:

def validate_refactored_code(old_code: str, new_code: str) -> bool:
    """
    Validates AI-generated refactored code against best practices.

    Args:
        old_code (str): Original function.
        new_code (str): Refactored function.

    Returns:
        bool: True if changes improve performance, False otherwise.
    """
    if len(new_code) > len(old_code) * 1.2:  # Ensure AI does not overcomplicate logic
        return False

    return True
âœ… Prevents AI from introducing redundant abstractions or unnecessary complexity.

ðŸ“Œ 5. AI Execution & Oversight Best Practices
ðŸ“Œ AI execution workflows must follow validation steps before modifying core project files.

ðŸ”¹ AI Execution Safety Guidelines
âœ… AI requires human confirmation before applying critical code changes.
âœ… AI logs all executed modifications for rollback and review.
âœ… AI must validate the success rate of past modifications before proposing similar changes.

ðŸ“Œ Example AI Execution Oversight:


def ai_execution_guardrail(modification: str) -> bool:
    """
    AI execution guardrail to validate if a modification should be applied.

    Args:
        modification (str): AI-generated code modification.

    Returns:
        bool: True if modification is safe, False otherwise.
    """
    risk_score = assess_code_change_risk(modification)
    return risk_score < 10  # Only allow low-risk changes
âœ… Prevents AI from making unintended modifications without validation.

ðŸ“Œ Summary
ðŸ“Œ This document provides structured AI best practices for:
âœ… AI-generated code formatting, structure, and readability
âœ… Debugging recall & execution workflows to optimize efficiency
âœ… ChromaDB-powered AI knowledge retrieval & validation
âœ… AI self-refactoring & optimization processes for continuous improvement
âœ… AI execution oversight to prevent unintended modifications

## Updated Section: Avoid Redundant Endpoint Detection
When referencing local LLM or Flask APIs, unify logic in a shared module
so that scripts like 'user_interaction_flow.py' do not duplicate code.

## Updated Section: Logging Consistency
Currently, we have multiple scripts for logging sessions or tasks (e.g., 'log_work_session.py'
and 'work_session_logger.py'). Teams should unify naming and fields to avoid confusion.

## Updated Section: Single 'network_utils' for environment detection
Repetitive 'detect_api_url()' methods exist in scripts like 'generate_work_summary.py'.
We recommend a single shared function to maintain consistency and reduce duplication.
