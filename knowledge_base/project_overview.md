# 🚀 AI Recall System - Project Overview  

## 📌 Mission Statement  

The **AI Recall System** is a **self-improving AI development assistant**, empowering engineers (and soon AI itself) to:  
✅ **Recall past implementations** of solutions across projects—e.g., “How did we fix rate limiting?”  
✅ **Retrieve debugging history** to skip redundant troubleshooting—e.g., “Show last 3 fixes.”  
✅ **Optimize workflows** with AI-powered code improvements—e.g., smarter refactors.  
✅ **Transition from human-assisted AI to fully autonomous execution**—self-debugging, self-building.  

🚀 **Current Status (03/04/2025)**: **AI Recall & Debugging (Phase 1)**—indexing done, agents next.  

📌 **Next Step**: AI begins **self-debugging and optimization**, paving the way for multi-agent workflows.

## 📌 Core Features  

### 🔹 AI-Powered Code & Knowledge Retrieval  

✅ AI **retrieves past implementations** from ChromaDB—110 code chunks in `project_codebase`, 266 doc chunks in `knowledge_base`.  
✅ AI **suggests relevant solutions** before generating new code—e.g., queries “error handling” → try/except hits.  
✅ AI **cross-references projects** for consistency—e.g., aligns fixes across `/code_base/` and `/frontend/`.  

📌 **Example Use Case**:  

ai-recall "How did we solve API rate limiting?"
🔹 AI Response Example:

[PAST SOLUTION FOUND]
Solution from 2025-03-04:
- Indexed in `project_codebase` (chunk_1, agent.py).
- Added retry logic with exponential backoff.
  
✅ Eliminates redundant problem-solving with past knowledge.
🔹 Self-Improving AI Debugging & Execution
✅ AI detects errors via watchers (index_codebase.py)—e.g., file changes trigger re-indexing.

✅ AI retrieves past fixes from Chroma—e.g., 110 chunks scanned in seconds.

✅ AI logs attempts to /logs/script_logs/—e.g., “Removed 2 old chunks for agent.py”.

📌 Example Debugging Query:

ai-debug "Show last 3 debugging sessions."
🔹 AI Response Example:


[DEBUG LOG: 2025-03-04]
Error: Mid-function chunk cut in agent.py
Fix Suggested: Increase chunk size to 500 lines (TBD)
Confidence Score: 85%

✅ Structured recall—human applies for now.
🔹 AI-Assisted Code Optimization & Refactoring
✅ AI analyzes past optimizations—e.g., knowledge_base (266 chunks) holds best practices.

✅ AI suggests refactors based on patterns—e.g., deduped README.md fixes (Issue #4 pending).

✅ AI validates via Chroma—e.g., checks against best_practices.md.

📌 Example AI Code Optimization:


def optimize_code_structure(current_code: str) -> str:
    """
    AI optimizes based on stored best practices.
    """
    refactored_code = retrieve_past_optimized_code(current_code)  # 110 chunks queried
    return refactored_code or current_code  # Best version wins
✅ Goal: Continuous efficiency—human nudge today, AI autonomy tomorrow.

🔹 Multi-Agent AI Expansion (Future Phase)
📌 Scalability: Designed for a Multi-Agent Framework.

🚀 Goal: From passive recall to active self-debugging and optimization.

Agent Roles
Agent Primary Role
Engineer Agent Writes/refactors code—e.g., spins up tools from project_codebase.
QA Agent Tests fixes—validates against knowledge_base.
Debug Agent Detects errors, applies fixes—logs to execution_logs (TBD).
Oversight Agent Monitors, prevents failures—syncs global_knowledge_base (TBD).
✅ Next: Stub agent.py, agent_manager.py—RAG loop live by Q2 2025.

📌 System Architecture Overview
🔹 Core Components
Component Purpose
Flask API (api_structure.py) Routes queries, execution (TBD—Phase 2).
LM Studio (Local Models) Runs prompts/suggestions (planned integration).
ChromaDB (chroma_db/) Vector storage—110 chunks (project_codebase), 266 (knowledge_base).
Copilot/Continue.dev (VS Code AI) Real-time dev assist (*optional tool).
CLI Commands (ai-recall, ai-debug) Manual recall/debug—evolving to agents.
Knowledge Base (knowledge_base/) Docs, history—25 files, 266 chunks indexed.
🚀 Current Setup:

Chroma: /mnt/f/projects/ai-recall-system/chroma_db/, all-MiniLM-L6-v2 embeddings.
Logging: /logs/script_logs/—e.g., “Processed 105 files, 110 chunks”.
Indexing: Watchers on /code_base/, header-based dedup for .md.
📌 Future Roadmap
Phase Goal AI Capability
Phase 1: AI Recall & Debugging ✅ Store/retrieve work—376 chunks total. Passive recall—done.
Phase 2: AI Self-Debugging ✅ Apply fixes automatically. Self-executing—Q2 2025.
Phase 3: AI Self-Refactoring ✅ Improve code autonomously. Optimization—Q3 2025.
Phase 4: Fully Autonomous AI ✅ Full project execution. Oversight only—2026.
🚀 Endgame: Autonomous dev assistant—local, relentless, yours.

📌 Summary
✅ AI Recall: 110 code + 266 doc chunks live, queried via retrieve_codebase.py.

✅ Debugging: Manual now—agents will close the loop (Issue #3, #4).

✅ Optimization: Best practices in knowledge_base, refactors TBD.

✅ Growth: From recall to autonomy—multi-agent city next.
