# 🏗️ Core Architecture - AI Recall System

## **🔹 System Components**
The AI Recall System consists of the following major components:


### 1️⃣ **📂 Knowledge Base System**
- Each project contains a **local knowledge base** (`knowledge_base/`).
- All projects **mirror their KB & indexed codebase** into `knowledge_base_global/` for AI-assisted cross-project awareness.

📂 **Example Structure:**
F:\projects
├── cannabis-compliance-ai
│ ├── knowledge_base\ <-- Project-specific documentation │ ├── knowledge_base_global\ <-- Mirrored into Global KB │ ├── codebase_index\ <-- Indexed code structure │ ├── music-collection-db
│ ├── knowledge_base
│ ├── knowledge_base_global
│ ├── codebase_index
│ └── knowledge_base_global\ <-- Stores all mirrored project KBs ├── cannabis-compliance-ai
├── music-collection-db
├── shared_ai_tools\


💡 **Every project maintains its own `knowledge_base/`, but updates get pushed into the `knowledge_base_global/` mirror for unified AI recall.**  

---

### 2️⃣ **📥 ChromaDB Vector Storage**
- Stores **indexed documentation & codebase embeddings.**
- Enables **fast AI retrieval** of structured knowledge.

📂 **ChromaDB Stores:**
✅ **Markdown Documentation (`knowledge_base/`)**  
✅ **Codebase Indexes (`codebase_index/`)**  
✅ **Error Logs & Debugging History (`debug_logs/`)**  
- Allows **semantic search for AI retrieval**.

---

### 3️⃣ **🤖 Mixtral (LLM)**
- Reads stored documentation **and suggests improvements.**
- Retrieves **relevant past solutions from ChromaDB.**
- Assists in **debugging by analyzing stored logs.**

---

### 4️⃣ **🛠️ Continue.dev Integration**
- Embeds **AI assistance inside VS Code**.
- Enables **real-time developer interaction with AI memory**.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# debugging_strategy.md

# 🛠️ AI-Assisted Debugging Strategy

## **🔹 Step 1: Retrieve Related Past Failures**
- AI should first **query ChromaDB for similar debugging logs.**
- If similar issue exists → Suggest past fix.
- If no match → Move to Step 2.

## **🔹 Step 2: Analyze Stack Trace & Error Logs**
- Extract key error messages from logs.
- Compare error with function signature.
- Determine **if failure is environment-specific or systemic.**

## **🔹 Step 3: Suggest Possible Fixes**
- Reference past successful resolutions.
- If issue is new → Generate fresh hypothesis.
- If fix is applied, **record new solution in ChromaDB for future recall.**

## **🔹 Example Query**
```plaintext
ai-debug "502 Bad Gateway in compliance-check API"

✅ **Now AI debugging isn’t just reactive—it’s structured and learnable.**

# project_initial_answers.md

# 🎯 AI-Assisted Project Initialization Answers  

## **Step 1: Understanding the Goal**  

### **1️⃣ What is the primary objective of this project?**  
📌 This project is an **AI-powered developer memory system** that provides **intelligent recall and debugging assistance** by storing and retrieving **project-specific and cross-project knowledge.**  

- **It will remember:** Past implementations, debugging history, feature discussions, architecture decisions, and problem-solving approaches.  
- **It will retrieve:** The most relevant information based on semantic search, ensuring solutions are always accessible.  
- **It will improve over time:** Learning from past work to make better suggestions.  

**This will act as an AI-powered Second Brain for software development.**  

---

### **2️⃣ Is this tool meant for personal use, a team, or as a SaaS?**  
📌 The system will initially be **personal** (for solo developers or small teams), allowing for fast iteration and testing.  

✅ The first version will run **locally** with optional cloud integration.  
✅ Long-term, it can be extended into a **multi-user SaaS**, where teams can collaborate on AI-powered recall and debugging.  
✅ Future versions may include **team-based memory sharing**, where AI retains project history across an entire engineering team.  

---

### **3️⃣ What are the key pain points this system solves?**  
📌 The biggest pain points in software development that this system solves include:  

- **Forgetting past solutions** → AI will instantly recall **relevant functions, fixes, and documentation.**  
- **Rewriting the same code across projects** → AI **suggests past implementations** from other projects.  
- **Losing track of debugging progress** → AI **logs every failure, resolution attempt, and fix** for future reference.  
- **Context switching inefficiencies** → AI **stores relevant knowledge across multiple projects**, reducing redundant research.  

This system ensures that **nothing important is lost and every problem solved once can be applied again.**  

---

### **4️⃣ Do you want AI to actively suggest solutions, or passively retrieve information?**  
📌 AI should do both, depending on the context.  

✅ **Active Suggestion Mode** (Default in IDE):  
- AI proactively **suggests solutions while writing code**.  
- AI **retrieves related functions or debugging fixes** based on the current code.  

✅ **Passive Retrieval Mode** (CLI Queries):  
- AI **only responds when explicitly asked via the CLI**.  
- The user queries AI for past solutions, architecture decisions, or debugging history.  

🔹 The AI **should adapt based on the user’s workflow**, but always provide **context-aware** assistance.  

---

### **5️⃣ Is this project meant to be self-contained, or part of a broader system?**  
📌 The AI recall system is **a foundational component that can be expanded** into multiple applications.  

- Initially, it will be **self-contained**, running locally with all knowledge stored on the developer’s machine.  
- In the long term, it will **connect to external knowledge bases** (GitHub repos, Stack Overflow, API documentation, etc.).  
- It can evolve into **a broader AI development workflow engine**, assisting in project creation, automation, and deployment.  

**The goal is to start small and scalable, ensuring modular extensibility.**  

---

## **Step 2: Defining the Core Features**  

### **6️⃣ What are the three most important features this system should have?**  
📌 The system must provide **AI-powered recall, structured debugging history, and cross-project awareness.**  

1️⃣ **📂 AI-Powered Recall**  
   - AI **instantly retrieves past solutions** based on similarity to the current task.  
   - Knowledge base supports **semantic search, prioritizing recency & relevance.**  

2️⃣ **🛠️ AI-Assisted Debugging Memory**  
   - AI **tracks error logs, failed API calls, and troubleshooting steps** for instant recall.  
   - AI suggests **fixes based on past debugging logs.**  

3️⃣ **🔄 Cross-Project Awareness**  
   - AI **references solutions across multiple projects** and interlinks them.  
   - **Mirrors knowledge bases** into a `knowledge_base_global/` for global recall.  

---

### **7️⃣ Should AI-assisted debugging be a priority, or should we focus on knowledge recall first?**  
📌 **Knowledge recall should come first, followed by debugging.**  

1️⃣ **Phase 1:** Implement **fast AI retrieval of stored solutions & past implementations.**  
2️⃣ **Phase 2:** Expand into **AI-powered debugging, error tracking, and logging.**  
3️⃣ **Phase 3:** Integrate **real-time AI assistance inside the IDE.**  

🚀 **This ensures AI can retrieve useful knowledge first, then apply that knowledge to debugging & troubleshooting.**  

---

### **8️⃣ Will this system integrate with VS Code, a CLI, or a web interface?**  
📌 Initially, this system will be **CLI-based**, allowing developers to retrieve information via terminal commands.  

```bash
ai-recall "How did we solve rate limiting before?"

✅ Once the core functionality is working, we will integrate with VS Code via Continue.dev for real-time AI suggestions.

Long-term, a web dashboard could allow for visualization of AI-assisted debugging history & knowledge graphs.

9️⃣ Do you need this to work across multiple machines, or just locally?
📌 Local-first, with potential for multi-device support.

✅ First version: Everything is stored locally for fast access.
✅ Later versions: Optional cloud synchronization to allow multi-machine access.
✅ Team-based SaaS version: Allows multiple developers to share an AI memory graph.

Step 3: Defining How AI Should Retrieve Information
🔟 How should information be retrieved? Should we prioritize recent knowledge over older data?
📌 AI retrieval should be semantic and context-aware, prioritizing recently used or referenced knowledge.

✅ Ranking Criteria for AI Retrieval:
1️⃣ Most recently modified or referenced files are prioritized.
2️⃣ Closest semantic match is returned first.
3️⃣ Past debugging attempts for the same error or issue are prioritized.

11️⃣ Should retrieval be semantic (meaning-based) or strictly keyword-driven?
📌 Retrieval should be primarily semantic, with keyword fallback.

Semantic search ensures AI pulls the most relevant insights even if phrasing is different.
Keyword fallback ensures that exact file names, function names, or API calls can still be retrieved.
🚀 The combination of both ensures accuracy and flexibility.

12️⃣ Should AI store every iteration of changes, or just the final version?
📌 AI should track meaningful changes, not every minor edit.

✅ Store major iterations & debugging resolutions.
✅ Track failed API calls & troubleshooting logs.
✅ Limit excessive storage of minor edits to avoid cluttering retrieval results.

🚀 This keeps AI recall useful without overwhelming search results.

Step 4: Long-Term Vision & Future Growth
13️⃣ What do we want this system to be capable of in 6 months?
📌 An AI-assisted development memory system that actively improves coding efficiency.

✅ Instant retrieval of past solutions across all projects.
✅ AI-assisted debugging with structured recall of past failures & fixes.
✅ Real-time VS Code integration for seamless AI-enhanced coding.

14️⃣ Should AI eventually automate parts of coding, or just assist in recall?
📌 AI should start as a recall tool but gradually assist in refactoring and feature generation.

🚀 The long-term goal is a self-improving AI-powered development assistant.

# 🎯 AI-Assisted Project Initialization Questions

## **Step 1: Understanding the Goal**
🟢 **AI Should Ask:**
- "What is the primary objective of this project?"
- "Is this tool meant for personal use, a team, or as a SaaS?"
- "What are the key pain points this system solves?"
- "Do you want AI to actively suggest solutions, or passively retrieve information?"
- "Is this project meant to be self-contained, or part of a broader system?"

💡 **Example Answer:**
_"This project is an AI-augmented memory & retrieval engine that will store, retrieve, and suggest relevant past work across projects. It should be useful for both real-time coding and debugging."_  

---

## **Step 2: Defining the Core Features**
🟢 **AI Should Ask:**
- "What are the three most important features this system should have?"
- "Should AI-assisted debugging be a priority, or should we focus on knowledge recall first?"
- "Will this system integrate with VS Code, a CLI, or a web interface?"
- "Do you need this to work across multiple machines, or just locally?"
- "Should AI store every iteration of changes, or just the final version?"

💡 **Example Answer:**
_"The most important features are: (1) AI-powered recall of past solutions, (2) an AI-assisted debugging log that remembers failures & fixes, and (3) a CLI-first implementation for rapid development."_  

---

## **Step 3: Defining How AI Should Retrieve Information**
🟢 **AI Should Ask:**
- "How should information be retrieved? Should we prioritize recent knowledge over older data?"
- "Should retrieval be semantic (meaning-based) or strictly keyword-driven?"
- "Do we need project-specific retrieval, or global cross-project searching?"
- "What level of accuracy do we expect for recall?"
- "Should we store metadata (timestamps, author, versioning) for every stored entry?"

💡 **Example Answer:**
_"AI should use semantic retrieval but prioritize recent knowledge over older entries. It should store metadata like timestamps and version numbers for debugging purposes."_  

---

## **Step 4: Setting Up Debugging & Error Tracking**
🟢 **AI Should Ask:**
- "Should AI actively log every error, or only major debugging sessions?"
- "Do we need AI-generated debugging reports, or just searchable logs?"
- "Should AI suggest debugging solutions automatically based on past failures?"
- "What kind of tagging should AI use for debugging logs?"
- "How long should debugging logs be retained before purging old data?"

💡 **Example Answer:**
_"AI should track all major debugging attempts but filter out minor logs. It should tag logs with project name, error type, and timestamp. AI should suggest fixes if a similar error has been encountered before."_  

---

## **Step 5: Planning for Long-Term Growth**
🟢 **AI Should Ask:**
- "What do we want this system to be capable of in 6 months?"
- "Should AI eventually automate parts of coding, or just assist in recall?"
- "Do we want AI to evolve into a more autonomous coding agent?"
- "Should AI store user feedback on its suggestions to improve accuracy?"
- "How should AI handle privacy & security for stored knowledge?"

💡 **Example Answer:**
_"In 6 months, this system should act as a personal AI software assistant that actively suggests improvements based on past work. It should evolve into an autonomous agent that can write and refactor code based on previous patterns."_

# 🎯 AI-Assisted Project Initialization Answers  

## **Step 1: Understanding the Goal**  

### **1️⃣ What is the primary objective of this project?**  
📌 This project is an **AI-powered developer memory system** that provides **intelligent recall and debugging assistance** by storing and retrieving **project-specific and cross-project knowledge.**  

- **It will remember:** Past implementations, debugging history, feature discussions, architecture decisions, and problem-solving approaches.  
- **It will retrieve:** The most relevant information based on semantic search, ensuring solutions are always accessible.  
- **It will improve over time:** Learning from past work to make better suggestions.  

**This will act as an AI-powered Second Brain for software development.**  

---

### **2️⃣ Is this tool meant for personal use, a team, or as a SaaS?**  
📌 The system will initially be **personal** (for solo developers or small teams), allowing for fast iteration and testing.  

✅ The first version will run **locally** with optional cloud integration.  
✅ Long-term, it can be extended into a **multi-user SaaS**, where teams can collaborate on AI-powered recall and debugging.  
✅ Future versions may include **team-based memory sharing**, where AI retains project history across an entire engineering team.  

---

### **3️⃣ What are the key pain points this system solves?**  
📌 The biggest pain points in software development that this system solves include:  

- **Forgetting past solutions** → AI will instantly recall **relevant functions, fixes, and documentation.**  
- **Rewriting the same code across projects** → AI **suggests past implementations** from other projects.  
- **Losing track of debugging progress** → AI **logs every failure, resolution attempt, and fix** for future reference.  
- **Context switching inefficiencies** → AI **stores relevant knowledge across multiple projects**, reducing redundant research.  

This system ensures that **nothing important is lost and every problem solved once can be applied again.**  

---

### **4️⃣ Do you want AI to actively suggest solutions, or passively retrieve information?**  
📌 AI should do both, depending on the context.  

✅ **Active Suggestion Mode** (Default in IDE):  
- AI proactively **suggests solutions while writing code**.  
- AI **retrieves related functions or debugging fixes** based on the current code.  

✅ **Passive Retrieval Mode** (CLI Queries):  
- AI **only responds when explicitly asked via the CLI**.  
- The user queries AI for past solutions, architecture decisions, or debugging history.  

🔹 The AI **should adapt based on the user’s workflow**, but always provide **context-aware** assistance.  

---

### **5️⃣ Is this project meant to be self-contained, or part of a broader system?**  
📌 The AI recall system is **a foundational component that can be expanded** into multiple applications.  

- Initially, it will be **self-contained**, running locally with all knowledge stored on the developer’s machine.  
- In the long term, it will **connect to external knowledge bases** (GitHub repos, Stack Overflow, API documentation, etc.).  
- It can evolve into **a broader AI development workflow engine**, assisting in project creation, automation, and deployment.  

**The goal is to start small and scalable, ensuring modular extensibility.**  

---

## **Step 2: Defining the Core Features**  

### **6️⃣ What are the three most important features this system should have?**  
📌 The system must provide **AI-powered recall, structured debugging history, and cross-project awareness.**  

1️⃣ **📂 AI-Powered Recall**  
   - AI **instantly retrieves past solutions** based on similarity to the current task.  
   - Knowledge base supports **semantic search, prioritizing recency & relevance.**  

2️⃣ **🛠️ AI-Assisted Debugging Memory**  
   - AI **tracks error logs, failed API calls, and troubleshooting steps** for instant recall.  
   - AI suggests **fixes based on past debugging logs.**  

3️⃣ **🔄 Cross-Project Awareness**  
   - AI **references solutions across multiple projects** and interlinks them.  
   - **Mirrors knowledge bases** into a `knowledge_base_global/` for global recall.  

---

### **7️⃣ Should AI-assisted debugging be a priority, or should we focus on knowledge recall first?**  
📌 **Knowledge recall should come first, followed by debugging.**  

1️⃣ **Phase 1:** Implement **fast AI retrieval of stored solutions & past implementations.**  
2️⃣ **Phase 2:** Expand into **AI-powered debugging, error tracking, and logging.**  
3️⃣ **Phase 3:** Integrate **real-time AI assistance inside the IDE.**  

🚀 **This ensures AI can retrieve useful knowledge first, then apply that knowledge to debugging & troubleshooting.**  

---

### **8️⃣ Will this system integrate with VS Code, a CLI, or a web interface?**  
📌 Initially, this system will be **CLI-based**, allowing developers to retrieve information via terminal commands.  

```bash
ai-recall "How did we solve rate limiting before?"

✅ Once the core functionality is working, we will integrate with VS Code via Continue.dev for real-time AI suggestions.

Long-term, a web dashboard could allow for visualization of AI-assisted debugging history & knowledge graphs.

9️⃣ Do you need this to work across multiple machines, or just locally?
📌 Local-first, with potential for multi-device support.

✅ First version: Everything is stored locally for fast access.
✅ Later versions: Optional cloud synchronization to allow multi-machine access.
✅ Team-based SaaS version: Allows multiple developers to share an AI memory graph.

Step 3: Defining How AI Should Retrieve Information
🔟 How should information be retrieved? Should we prioritize recent knowledge over older data?
📌 AI retrieval should be semantic and context-aware, prioritizing recently used or referenced knowledge.

✅ Ranking Criteria for AI Retrieval:
1️⃣ Most recently modified or referenced files are prioritized.
2️⃣ Closest semantic match is returned first.
3️⃣ Past debugging attempts for the same error or issue are prioritized.

11️⃣ Should retrieval be semantic (meaning-based) or strictly keyword-driven?
📌 Retrieval should be primarily semantic, with keyword fallback.

Semantic search ensures AI pulls the most relevant insights even if phrasing is different.
Keyword fallback ensures that exact file names, function names, or API calls can still be retrieved.
🚀 The combination of both ensures accuracy and flexibility.

12️⃣ Should AI store every iteration of changes, or just the final version?
📌 AI should track meaningful changes, not every minor edit.

✅ Store major iterations & debugging resolutions.
✅ Track failed API calls & troubleshooting logs.
✅ Limit excessive storage of minor edits to avoid cluttering retrieval results.

🚀 This keeps AI recall useful without overwhelming search results.

Step 4: Long-Term Vision & Future Growth
13️⃣ What do we want this system to be capable of in 6 months?
📌 An AI-assisted development memory system that actively improves coding efficiency.

✅ Instant retrieval of past solutions across all projects.
✅ AI-assisted debugging with structured recall of past failures & fixes.
✅ Real-time VS Code integration for seamless AI-enhanced coding.

14️⃣ Should AI eventually automate parts of coding, or just assist in recall?
📌 AI should start as a recall tool but gradually assist in refactoring and feature generation.

🚀 The long-term goal is a self-improving AI-powered development assistant.

- Blueprint scores **accurately reflect execution history.**
- AI correctly **flags low-performing blueprints for revision.**

---

## **📌 Week 2 Exit Criteria (Sunday 2/25)**

✅ **AI logs every execution linked to a blueprint.**

✅ **AI proposes structured blueprint revisions based on inefficiencies.**

✅ **Blueprint versions are stored, retrievable, and version-controlled.**

✅ **AI prioritizes blueprint updates based on execution success rate.**

✅ **System is ready for AI Execution in Week 3.**

---

# **📌 Week 3: AI Execution & Self-Improvement (Feb 26 - Mar 3)**

**🎯 Goals**

1️⃣ **AI starts executing tasks based on blueprints, tracking success.**

2️⃣ **AI auto-refines execution logic based on historical performance.**

3️⃣ **AI integrates multi-agent potential through blueprint-based execution.**

4️⃣ **Ensure AI can iteratively refine workflows over time.**

✅ **This final week stays the same—we just slightly shifted the earlier timeline.**

---

### **🚀 Summary: What Changed?**

✅ **Week 1 now focuses on getting ChromaDB fully functional before Tuesday.**

✅ **Week 2 moves into Recursive Blueprinting once we have a functional AI Recall system.**

✅ **Week 3 stays the same: AI Execution based on Recursive Blueprinting.**

# Blueprint Execution Logs

- AI needs a **reason to generate new tasks, evaluate execution, and refine itself.**
- That "reason" comes from a **structured execution loop** that constantly asks:

**1️⃣ "What am I supposed to do next?"**

**2️⃣ "How well did my last task go?"**

**3️⃣ "What should I do differently next time?"**

📌 **The simplest way to create momentum is a structured execution cycle.**

### **📌 The Role of BELogs: AI’s First Layer of "Memory"**

🔹 **Blueprint Execution Logs (BELogs) serve as AI’s running self-analysis.**

🔹 This is where AI starts tracking:

✅ **What tasks it attempts**

✅ **What worked, what failed**

✅ **What needs improvement**

✅ **How execution efficiency changes over time**

📌 **BELogs will be AI’s first method of "self-reflection"—instead of just executing and moving on, it will learn from past execution cycles.**

### **📌 The AI Execution Loop (Momentum Engine)**

💡 **Once BELogs exist, we introduce AI execution logic that follows this flow:**

| **Step** | **AI's Thought Process** | **System Action** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **1️⃣ Retrieve last execution log** | "What was I doing last?" | Fetch latest BELog from ChromaDB |
| **2️⃣ Evaluate execution results** | "Did my last attempt succeed or fail?" | AI reads past execution outcomes |
| **3️⃣ Identify problems & inefficiencies** | "What went wrong? What can be improved?" | AI analyzes logs for errors, slow tasks, inefficiencies |
| **4️⃣ Generate a new task** | "Based on what I learned, what should I do next?" | AI proposes a new execution step |
| **5️⃣ Execute new task** | "Let’s try this improved approach!" | AI executes task, logs execution in BELogs |
| **6️⃣ Loop back to Step 1** | "Did my new attempt work better?" | Repeat process & refine execution |

📌 **This loop creates the foundation for AI self-iteration.**

## **📌 What Will BELogs Contain?**

BELogs will track:

✅ **Task Name** – What did AI attempt?

✅ **Execution Time** – How long did it take?

✅ **Files Changed** – What code did AI modify?

✅ **Errors Encountered** – What problems occurred?

✅ **Outcome** – Was the execution successful?

✅ **Efficiency Score** – How efficient was the task compared to past runs?

✅ **Improvement Suggestions** – What should AI do differently next time?

📌 **With this information, AI can begin systematically improving how it works.**

### **📌 How Does BELogging Transition into AI Self-Improvement?**

🔹 Once AI tracks execution logs (BELogs), it **can begin making revisions to its own workflows** using **Blueprint Revision Proposals (BRPs).**

🔹 This allows AI to **refine execution strategies dynamically** rather than repeating the same inefficient patterns.

🚀 **This is where AI begins "thinking about its own execution" instead of just blindly executing**

### **📌 Should BELogs Track the Overall Goal of an Execution Task?**

💡 **Your intuition is correct—if BELogs only track individual tasks, AI could get “stuck” iterating too narrowly.**

✅ **Yes, we should include an overarching "Execution Context" field** to ensure AI stays aligned with **higher-level goals** rather than myopically refining isolated tasks.

📌 **Each AI execution log should track the following key attributes:**

| **Field** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Timestamp** | When the execution happened |
| **Execution Context** | The high-level goal this task contributes to |
| **Task Name** | What AI attempted |
| **Expected Outcome** | What AI was trying to achieve |
| **Execution Time** | How long the task took |
| **Files Changed** | Any files AI modified |
| **Errors Encountered** | Any failures or unexpected issues |
| **Success/Failure** | Whether the execution succeeded |
| **Efficiency Score** | How well AI executed the task compared to past attempts |
| **Improvement Suggestions** | How AI could refine the task next time |
| **Dependencies Affected** | APIs, databases, or libraries involved in execution |
| **Pipeline Connections** | Other parts of the system that interact with this task |
| **Potential Breakage Risk** | Does this change impact downstream components? |
| **Cross-Check Required?** | Should AI check related scripts/pipeline elements? |

# 🤖 AI Coding Guidelines  

## **📌 Overview**  

This document defines the **coding standards & best practices** for AI-generated code in the AI Recall System.  

🚀 **Primary Goals:**  
✅ **Ensure AI writes modular, readable, and maintainable code**  
✅ **Standardize AI-generated function structures and documentation**  
✅ **Prevent AI from introducing redundant or inefficient logic**  
✅ **Guide AI-assisted debugging and code self-refactoring processes**  

---

## **📌 1. AI Code Generation Best Practices**  

📌 **AI-generated code must follow a structured format to ensure readability and maintainability.**  

### **🔹 Required Structure for AI-Generated Functions**

✅ **Every function must have a clear docstring describing its purpose and parameters.**  
✅ **AI must include inline comments for complex logic.**  
✅ **Variable names should be descriptive and follow `snake_case`.**  

📌 **Example AI-Generated Function:**

```python
def fetch_latest_debug_logs(limit: int = 5) -> list:
    """
    Retrieves the latest debugging logs from ChromaDB.

    Args:
        limit (int): Number of logs to retrieve.

    Returns:
        list: A list of debugging log entries.
    """
    logs = query_chroma_db("SELECT * FROM debug_logs ORDER BY timestamp DESC LIMIT ?", [limit])
    return logs
✅ This ensures AI-generated code is readable, well-documented, and reusable.

📌 2. AI Self-Refactoring Guidelines
📌 AI must follow strict validation steps when refactoring code to prevent unintended changes.

🔹 AI Refactoring Workflow
1️⃣ Retrieve previous versions of the function from ChromaDB.
2️⃣ Analyze performance & redundancy before refactoring.
3️⃣ Apply changes incrementally and verify against test cases.
4️⃣ Log modifications for future AI recall.

📌 Example AI Refactoring Validation:

python
Copy
Edit
def validate_refactored_code(old_code: str, new_code: str) -> bool:
    """
    Compares old and new code to ensure refactoring improved performance and readability.

    Args:
        old_code (str): Original function code.
        new_code (str): Refactored function code.

    Returns:
        bool: True if changes are valid, False otherwise.
    """
    if len(new_code) < len(old_code) * 0.9:  # Ensure refactor does not introduce unnecessary complexity
        return False

    return True  # If refactor passes validation, return True
✅ Prevents AI from making unnecessary modifications that worsen code quality.

📌 3. Debugging & Error Handling Standards
📌 AI must follow a structured debugging approach when identifying & fixing errors.

🔹 AI Debugging Workflow
✅ Step 1: AI logs detected errors in debug_logs.json.
✅ Step 2: AI retrieves past debugging solutions before suggesting a fix.
✅ Step 3: AI applies the fix (if in self-debugging mode) or recommends the change to the user.

📌 Example AI Debugging Entry

json
Copy
Edit
{
    "timestamp": "2025-02-10 14:23:11",
    "error": "SQL Integrity Constraint Violation",
    "fix_applied": "Added unique constraint to the schema.",
    "developer_reviewed": true
}
✅ Ensures AI debugging recall is structured and reliable.

📌 4. AI Code Review & Validation Process
📌 All AI-generated code must be validated before execution.

🔹 AI Code Review Checklist
✔ Function structure follows defined best practices.
✔ Variables and function names are descriptive and consistent.
✔ No redundant or unnecessary loops introduced.
✔ Changes do not impact system performance negatively.

📌 Example AI Code Review Process:

python
Copy
Edit
def review_ai_generated_code(code_snippet: str) -> bool:
    """
    Reviews AI-generated code to ensure it follows best practices.

    Args:
        code_snippet (str): AI-generated Python function.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the code is valid, False otherwise.
    """
    if "def " not in code_snippet or '"""' not in code_snippet:
        return False  # Ensure function has a docstring

    if "for " in code_snippet and "while " in code_snippet:
        return False  # Ensure AI does not introduce unnecessary loops

    return True
✅ Prevents AI from introducing low-quality or redundant code.

📌 5. ChromaDB Integration for AI Code Recall
📌 AI retrieves stored coding patterns & debugging solutions before writing new code.

🔹 AI Knowledge Retrieval Workflow
1️⃣ Query ChromaDB for past function implementations.
2️⃣ Compare retrieved results against the current task.
3️⃣ Modify existing solutions before generating entirely new code.

📌 Example ChromaDB Query for AI Code Retrieval

python
Copy
Edit
def query_ai_codebase(search_term: str) -> list:
    """
    Queries ChromaDB for AI-generated code snippets related to the search term.

    Args:
        search_term (str): The keyword to search for.

    Returns:
        list: A list of matching code snippets.
    """
    results = query_chroma_db(f"SELECT snippet FROM codebase WHERE description LIKE '%{search_term}%'")
    return results
✅ Ensures AI reuses stored knowledge instead of generating redundant solutions.

📌 6. AI Multi-Agent Collaboration for Code Execution
📌 Future AI development will involve multiple agents working together on self-improving code.

Agent Role
Engineer Agent Writes & refactors AI-generated code.
QA Agent Tests AI modifications before execution.
Oversight Agent Prevents AI from making unauthorized code changes.
🚀 Goal: AI agents coordinate to generate, review, and optimize code collaboratively.

📌 Summary
📌 This document ensures AI-generated code follows structured guidelines for:
✅ Readability, maintainability, and best practices
✅ AI self-refactoring & validation workflows
✅ Debugging recall & structured AI troubleshooting
✅ ChromaDB-powered AI knowledge retrieval
✅ Multi-agent AI collaboration for future code execution

# 📄 AI Debugging Debrief Format  

## **📌 Overview**

This document defines the **standardized debugging debrief process** used by the AI Recall System.  

🚀 **Primary Goals:**  
✅ **Ensure AI logs debugging issues, solutions, and outcomes consistently.**  
✅ **Enable AI to retrieve past debugging sessions from ChromaDB.**  
✅ **Allow AI to refine its problem-solving methods over time.**  

📌 **AI debugging debriefs ensure system self-improvement and prevent repeated troubleshooting cycles.**  

---

## **📌 1. AI Debugging Workflow**  

📌 **AI follows a structured workflow when debugging issues:**  

| **Stage** | **Process** |
|-----------|------------|
| **Stage 1: Error Detection** | AI detects failure & logs details into `debug_logs.json`. |
| **Stage 2: Debugging Recall** | AI queries ChromaDB for past debugging attempts. |
| **Stage 3: Solution Suggestion** | AI suggests the most relevant past fix. |
| **Stage 4: Fix Execution** | AI applies or recommends a fix (depending on user preference). |
| **Stage 5: Validation & Learning** | AI evaluates the success of the applied fix and updates knowledge. |

🚀 **Goal:** AI **retrieves and applies past solutions before generating new debugging workflows.**  

---

## **📌 2. AI Debugging Log Format**  

📌 **AI stores debugging logs in `debug_logs.json` for retrieval & analysis.**  

### **🔹 Standard Debugging Log Entry**  

```json
{
    "timestamp": "2025-02-10 14:23:11",
    "error": "SQL Integrity Constraint Violation",
    "stack_trace": "File 'db_handler.py', line 42, in execute_query...",
    "fix_attempted": "Added unique constraint to the schema.",
    "fix_successful": true,
    "ai_confidence_score": 0.95
}
✅ Ensures debugging logs capture issue details, attempted solutions, and success rates.

📌 3. AI Debugging Retrieval & Solution Matching
📌 AI queries ChromaDB to retrieve past debugging sessions before generating new fixes.

🔹 ChromaDB Debugging Query Example
python
Copy
Edit
def retrieve_debugging_logs(error_message: str) -> list:
    """
    Queries ChromaDB for past debugging logs related to the given error message.

    Args:
        error_message (str): Error description to search for.

    Returns:
        list: Matching debugging log entries.
    """
    query = f"SELECT * FROM debug_logs WHERE error LIKE '%{error_message}%'"
    return query_chroma_db(query)
✅ Allows AI to reuse past debugging attempts instead of starting from scratch.

📌 4. AI Debugging Debrief Template
📌 AI automatically generates a debugging debrief after resolving an issue.

🔹 Standard AI Debugging Debrief Format
🔹 Task Name: [Brief Description of Debugging Task]
🔹 Files Modified: [List of modified files]
🔹 Functions Edited: [List of changed functions]
🔹 Error Logs: [Stack trace & debugging details]
🔹 AI Debugging Summary: [Steps taken, solutions attempted, and failures encountered]

✅ Ensures AI debugging memory is structured and retrievable for future reference.

📌 5. AI Debugging Evaluation & Learning
📌 After applying a fix, AI evaluates its effectiveness to refine future debugging suggestions.

🔹 AI Debugging Evaluation Metrics
Metric Purpose
Solution Reuse Rate Measures how often a past fix successfully resolves a new issue.
Fix Success Rate Tracks the percentage of debugging attempts that resolved the issue.
AI Confidence Score AI assigns a confidence level to suggested fixes.
Self-Validation Accuracy AI checks if applied fixes align with stored debugging history.
🚀 Goal: AI continuously improves debugging recall and solution accuracy.

📌 6. AI Debugging Validation & Testing
📌 Ensuring AI debugging recall & execution is accurate and reliable.

✅ Test Case 1: Debugging Recall Accuracy
📌 Test Goal: Ensure AI retrieves past debugging logs accurately.
🔹 Test Command:

bash
Copy
Edit
ai-debug "Retrieve last 3 debugging sessions."
✅ Pass Criteria:

AI retrieves 3 relevant past debugging logs.
AI response matches previously stored error resolutions.
✅ Test Case 2: AI-Suggested Fix Accuracy
📌 Test Goal: Ensure AI suggests previously applied fixes when debugging similar issues.
🔹 Test Command:

bash
Copy
Edit
ai-debug "Suggest a fix for a database integrity error."
✅ Pass Criteria:

AI retrieves past solutions from ChromaDB.

# 📖 AI Best Practices - AI Recall System  

## **📌 Overview**  

This document outlines the **best practices for AI-generated code, debugging recall, and workflow execution.**  

🚀 **Primary Goals:**  
✅ **Ensure AI follows structured and efficient development workflows**  
✅ **Standardize AI-generated code for readability, reusability, and maintainability**  
✅ **Optimize AI debugging recall & execution to prevent redundant problem-solving**  
✅ **Ensure AI self-improves and executes solutions efficiently**  

---

## **📌 1. AI Code Generation Best Practices**  

📌 **All AI-generated code must follow structured, maintainable, and reusable formats.**  

### **🔹 AI Code Formatting Standards**

✅ **Use `snake_case` for variable and function names.**  
✅ **Ensure all functions include a docstring with clear descriptions.**  
✅ **Limit function complexity—prefer small, modular functions.**  
✅ **Avoid redundant logic—AI must retrieve stored solutions before generating new code.**  

📌 **Example AI-Generated Code (Correct Format):**

```python
def fetch_recent_debug_logs(limit: int = 5) -> list:
    """
    Retrieves the most recent debugging logs from ChromaDB.

    Args:
        limit (int): Number of logs to retrieve.

    Returns:
        list: A list of debugging log entries.
    """
    logs = query_chroma_db("SELECT * FROM debug_logs ORDER BY timestamp DESC LIMIT ?", [limit])
    return logs
✅ This ensures AI-generated code is structured, documented, and follows best practices.

📌 2. AI Debugging & Execution Best Practices
📌 AI debugging recall & execution must follow structured retrieval and validation protocols.

🔹 AI Debugging Workflow
✅ Step 1: AI retrieves debugging logs before generating new fixes.
✅ Step 2: AI prioritizes past solutions that were successfully applied.
✅ Step 3: AI ranks solutions based on confidence and context relevance.
✅ Step 4: AI suggests or applies the highest-confidence fix.

📌 Example AI Debugging Retrieval Execution:


ai-debug "Retrieve last 3 debugging sessions."
🔹 AI Response Example:


[DEBUG LOG: 2025-02-10]
Error: SQL Integrity Constraint Violation
Fix Applied: Added unique constraint in schema.
Confidence Score: 98%
✅ Prevents redundant debugging attempts and optimizes AI problem-solving efficiency.

📌 3. AI Knowledge Retrieval & ChromaDB Best Practices
📌 AI retrieval logic must prioritize accuracy, context relevance, and structured storage.

🔹 AI Query Execution Guidelines
✅ AI must first check ChromaDB for previous solutions before generating new ones.
✅ AI should rank retrieved solutions based on success rates and context similarity.
✅ AI should log every retrieval attempt and its effectiveness for self-improvement.

📌 Example AI Knowledge Query Execution:


def retrieve_past_solution(query: str) -> list:
    """
    Queries ChromaDB for stored past solutions related to the given query.

    Args:
        query (str): Description of the issue.

    Returns:
        list: Retrieved solutions ranked by confidence score.
    """
    return query_chroma_db(f"SELECT solution FROM work_logs WHERE issue LIKE '%{query}%' ORDER BY confidence DESC LIMIT 3")
✅ Ensures AI queries prioritize relevant, high-confidence solutions before proposing fixes.

📌 4. AI Self-Refactoring & Code Optimization Best Practices
📌 AI self-refactoring should be efficient, performance-aware, and prevent unnecessary complexity.

🔹 AI Code Optimization Workflow
✅ AI must compare past optimized code snippets before modifying existing code.
✅ AI should refactor functions for efficiency without affecting core logic.
✅ AI should validate refactored code against test cases before execution.

📌 Example AI Refactoring Validation:

def validate_refactored_code(old_code: str, new_code: str) -> bool:
    """
    Validates AI-generated refactored code against best practices.

    Args:
        old_code (str): Original function.
        new_code (str): Refactored function.

    Returns:
        bool: True if changes improve performance, False otherwise.
    """
    if len(new_code) > len(old_code) * 1.2:  # Ensure AI does not overcomplicate logic
        return False

    return True
✅ Prevents AI from introducing redundant abstractions or unnecessary complexity.

📌 5. AI Execution & Oversight Best Practices
📌 AI execution workflows must follow validation steps before modifying core project files.

🔹 AI Execution Safety Guidelines
✅ AI requires human confirmation before applying critical code changes.
✅ AI logs all executed modifications for rollback and review.
✅ AI must validate the success rate of past modifications before proposing similar changes.

📌 Example AI Execution Oversight:


def ai_execution_guardrail(modification: str) -> bool:
    """
    AI execution guardrail to validate if a modification should be applied.

    Args:
        modification (str): AI-generated code modification.

    Returns:
        bool: True if modification is safe, False otherwise.
    """
    risk_score = assess_code_change_risk(modification)
    return risk_score < 10  # Only allow low-risk changes
✅ Prevents AI from making unintended modifications without validation.

📌 Summary
📌 This document provides structured AI best practices for:
✅ AI-generated code formatting, structure, and readability
✅ Debugging recall & execution workflows to optimize efficiency
✅ ChromaDB-powered AI knowledge retrieval & validation

# **Future Proofing - AI Recall System**

This document provides guidelines and best practices to ensure the **AI Recall System** (and any associated workflows) remain adaptable over the next 1–2 years and beyond. The AI field moves quickly, so these strategies emphasize **layered design**, **modular architecture**, and **open standards** to accommodate new models, tools, and expansions as they arise.

---

## **1. Modular, Layered Architecture**

A future-proof system often separates concerns into distinct layers that can be swapped or upgraded independently:

1. **Data Layer**
   - Store logs, code references, debug records, and metadata in open formats (e.g. JSON, Markdown).
   - Keep a consistent schema for debugging logs and code references to ensure easy migration if you switch database engines.

2. **Core Logic / Domain Layer**
   - Encapsulate how the system ingests logs, references code, triggers recalls, etc.
   - Avoid tying logic too closely to a single LLM or vector database.
   - Example: Provide methods like `store_debug_log()`, `retrieve_past_solution()`, or `update_knowledge()` that remain stable, even if your LLM or DB changes.

3. **Model / AI Layer**
   - Create an abstraction for LLM calls—e.g., `run_llm(prompt)`—so you can change from GPT-4 to Llama 2 or Mistral with minimal disruption.
   - Keep prompt templates and chain logic in a separate module or config so it’s easy to update or fine-tune.

4. **Presentation Layer**
   - Any CLIs, web dashboards, or Slack integrations are decoupled from the internal recall logic.
   - You can experiment with new UIs or integrate with different editors (VS Code, JetBrains) without a major refactor.

By cleanly separating these concerns, your system can evolve or integrate new AI tech without an entire rebuild.

---

## **2. Abstract Dependencies & Use Open Formats**

**Abstract Away External Tools**  

- Wrap vector database calls and LLM calls in your own interfaces (e.g. `VectorStore` interface, `LLMService` interface).  
- Minimizes changes if you later adopt a different vector DB or switch from OpenAI to another model provider.

**Open-Source & Open Standards**  

- Prefer Markdown, JSON, or YAML for storing knowledge, logs, blueprint documents.  
- If you use a vector DB (Chroma, Weaviate, Postgres+pgvector), ensure you can export / import easily.  
- Rely on commonly used libraries with large community support (e.g., Python, Docker) to avoid vendor lock-in.

---

## **3. Summarization & Tiered Memory**

Over time, you will accumulate a *lot* of logs, code snippets, blueprint files, etc. Plan for **tiered memory**:

1. **Short-Term / Active Memory**  
   - Store the last N logs or the most recent week’s changes in a high-performance index.
2. **Medium-Term Summaries**  
   - Summarize older logs into condensed “memory blocks,” merging recurring events or older solutions.
3. **Long-Term Archive**  
   - Keep full raw data in compressed archives. Retrieve / re-index only when absolutely necessary.

This prevents the system from drowning in old data. Summarization and archiving keep the system nimble while preserving the ability to revisit older knowledge when needed.

---

## **4. Automated Testing & CI/CD**

1. **Unit Tests + Integration Tests**  
   - Test each major function or pipeline (e.g., storing logs in the vector DB, retrieving them, feeding them to an LLM).
   - Ensure you have test coverage for each step of your recall and debugging workflows.

2. **Continuous Integration (CI)**  
   - Even as a solo dev, set up GitHub Actions or another CI tool to run tests automatically on each commit or pull request.
   - Catch breaking changes early (especially if you switch LLM or vector DB versions).

3. **System Health Checks**  
   - For a continuously running agent or service, have “health endpoints” or logs that confirm the vector DB is reachable, LLM calls are succeeding, etc.
   - This helps with early detection if a library update breaks something.

By baking in automated tests, you can confidently adopt new tools or approaches.

---

## **5. Stay Flexible with Model Choices**

Because LLM performance evolves rapidly:

1. **Support Both Local & Remote Models**
   - Use GPT-4 (API) or other cloud-based LLMs for advanced reasoning.
   - Keep an open-source local model in Docker as a fallback for quick tasks or offline scenarios.
   - Let the user (or config) choose which model to use for each job.

2. **Fine-Tuning or Instruction Tuning**
   - Keep logs and code snippets in an easily ingestible format so you can do a LoRA or full fine-tune if new open models become competitive.
   - This ensures you can benefit from future large open-source or specialized LLMs.

---

## **6. Composable Building Blocks**

Given that your interests are unorthodox, building small, composable modules is crucial for re-purposing them in creative ways:

- **Document Ingestion**: A module that reads any file or text source, transforms and indexes it.
- **Semantic Retrieval**: A module that finds relevant knowledge or logs from your DB.
- **Post-Processing**: Maybe a summarizer or code-generation step.
- **Workflow Orchestrator**: Ties tasks together (ingestion → retrieval → generation → action).

Keeping them discrete means you can combine them in unusual ways or apply them to new tasks (e.g. auto-indexing music metadata, archiving esoteric text, etc.) without rewriting the entire system.

---

## **7. Early MVP & Quick Passive Revenue**

While future-proofing is key, don’t over-engineer:

- Launch a **minimal, stable** product or sub-tool that solves a known pain point (e.g. “AI doc generator,” “PDF summarizer,” “Auto bug-fix recall for devs”).
- Gather real usage data; see which expansions people request.
- Use revenue or feedback to shape your next steps. Often, you’ll discover the real constraints and biggest needs only once you have real users.

Balancing “weird future expansions” with near-term monetization is essential.

---

## **8. Maintain a Living Roadmap**

- **Short-Term (Weeks/Months)**: The next tasks for building MVP, generating early revenue, refining the recall system.
- **Mid-Term (3–6 Months)**: Introduce advanced multi-agent or self-improvement loops, or expand to new data domains.
- **Long-Term (1–2 Years)**: Possibly host multiple specialized AI agents, integrate with bigger ecosystems, adopt new LLM breakthroughs.

Periodically update this roadmap. If a new model or major library emerges, see if it fits a short- or mid-term milestone. This ensures you adapt without discarding your entire architecture.

---

## **Summary**

By following these **eight** key guidelines, your AI Recall System can evolve gracefully:

1. **Design a layered architecture** (Data, Domain, Model, Presentation).  
2. **Abstract dependencies** and use open formats for logs & knowledge.  
3. **Plan for tiered memory** with summarization and archiving.  
4. **Automate testing & integrate CI** for stable, rapid iteration.  
5. **Stay flexible with model choices** (local vs. cloud).  
6. **Build composable building blocks** that you can mix and match for unorthodox workflows.  
7. **Deliver MVPs quickly** for near-term passive revenue, then expand.  
8. **Keep a living roadmap** so you can pivot to new breakthroughs with minimal friction.

Following these strategies ensures your **ai-recall** project remains valuable and adaptable, no matter how fast AI technology evolves.

# 🏗️ Technical Design Decisions

## **🔹 Why LM Studio for Model Execution?**

✅ **Lightweight and efficient for local LLM execution**  
✅ **Allows full control over model selection & usage**  
✅ **Runs models via Flask API for seamless agent integration**  
✅ **Avoids cloud-based API costs & licensing restrictions**  

## **🔹 Why Flask API as the Backend?**

✅ **Simple & efficient for serving local AI models**  
✅ **Integrates seamlessly with LM Studio**  
✅ **Works across Windows & WSL without network conflicts**  
✅ **Lightweight enough to maintain high-speed interactions**  

## **🔹 API Connectivity Handling**

Your system ensures **no connection refusals** by detecting the correct API endpoint:

```python
def detect_api_url(self):
    """Detect the correct API URL based on whether we are in WSL or native Windows."""
    wsl_ip = "172.17.128.1"
    default_url = "http://localhost:1234/v1/chat/completions"

    try:
        with open("/proc/version", "r") as f:
            if "microsoft" in f.read().lower():
                print(f"🔹 Detected WSL! Using Windows IP: {wsl_ip}")
                return f"http://{wsl_ip}:1234/v1/chat/completions"
    except FileNotFoundError:
        pass

    print(f"🔹 Using default API URL: {default_url}")
    return default_url

🚀 Ensures stable AI model interaction regardless of OS environment.**

🔹 AI Model Selection

🔥 Refining Model Selection – How Many Do We Need?
We need three categories of models to cover all use cases:

Category Purpose Model(s)
Primary Coder AI that writes, refactors, and debugs code deepseek-coder-33b-instruct ✅
General Reasoning Model Handles broader questions, logic-based reasoning, summarization, and context handling Recommended: Mistral-7B-Instruct or Yi-34B
Backup Small Model Lightweight, quick-response fallback when 33B is too heavy Recommended: deepseek-coder-6.7B or Yi-9B
📌 TL;DR: We should have at least 3 models running
1️⃣ Primary Code Model → deepseek-coder-33b-instruct (already in use)
2️⃣ General Knowledge Model → Mistral-7B-Instruct (best mix of size & reasoning ability)
3️⃣ Backup Small Model → deepseek-coder-6.7B (fast, good for quick tasks)

✅ Why Mistral-7B-Instruct?

Apache 2.0 Licensed (safe for commercial use)
Fast execution (lighter than 33B but still powerful for reasoning tasks)
Balanced general knowledge & context retention


🚀 We avoid Meta Llama 3 due to licensing issues.
🚀 Mixtral is currently unavailable due to tensor errors in LM Studio.

🔹 Why Continue.dev for AI-Powered Code Assistance?
✅ Integrates directly into VS Code
✅ Uses @codebase for AI-powered retrieval
✅ Enables real-time debugging & knowledge recall

🔹 Why ChromaDB for Vector Storage?
✅ Fast semantic search for AI-powered retrieval
✅ Local-first, but scalable to cloud if needed
✅ Easier to manage than Pinecone or Weaviate for a single-developer project

# 🧑‍💻 User Interaction Flow - AI Recall System

## **📌 Overview**

This document outlines **how the AI Recall System interacts with both human developers and autonomous AI workflows**.  

🚀 **Current State:**  

- Developers interact via **CLI, Continue.dev, and API requests**  
- AI assists with **code retrieval, debugging recall, and structured work memory**  

🌍 **Future Goal:**  

- AI **self-queries past solutions automatically**  
- AI autonomously **retrieves debugging logs & executes self-fixes**  
- Human oversight is **reserved for validation & creativity, not manual recall**  

✅ **Access Points for Interaction:**  

- **CLI Commands** → Manual retrieval of past knowledge & debugging logs  
- **Continue.dev in VS Code** → AI-assisted coding for human developers  
- **AI-to-AI Querying** (Future) → AI autonomously queries & applies past knowledge  

---

## **📌 Current Human-to-AI Workflows (Manual Interactions)**

📌 **Today, developers interact with the system using:**  

| **Method** | **Description** |
|------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **CLI Commands** | Manually retrieve knowledge & debug history. |
| **Continue.dev AI Chat** | Ask AI for coding help inside VS Code. |
| **API Endpoints** | Query stored knowledge for external integrations. |

📌 **Example CLI Usage**

```bash
ai-recall "How did we solve API rate limiting?"
✅ Retrieves past solutions from ChromaDB

📌 Future AI-to-AI Workflow (Autonomous Queries)
📌 As the system evolves, AI will automatically handle recall & debugging.

Process Future AI Behavior
Self-Querying Past Work AI autonomously checks past debugging logs before proposing fixes.
Code Improvement Suggestions AI proactively recommends optimizations based on stored best practices.
Self-Triage of Issues AI detects errors and retrieves past solutions before executing a fix.
📌 Example AI Behavior (Future) 🚀 Instead of the developer typing:

bash
Copy
Edit
ai-debug "What was the last database error?"
✅ The AI will autonomously run the same query, fetch results, and apply a fix without human intervention.

📌 Continue.dev - AI-Assisted Coding in VS Code
📌 Currently, developers manually query AI for suggestions.
📌 Eventually, the AI will use Continue.dev APIs to self-optimize codebases.

Feature Current Use Future AI Behavior
@codebase Manually retrieve code snippets AI auto-searches relevant project files
@docs Pull documentation manually AI references docs before executing fixes
AI Chat Direct human interaction AI-to-AI querying for workflow automation
📌 Future AI Workflow Example 1️⃣ AI encounters an error in api_structure.py
2️⃣ AI queries debugging logs autonomously
3️⃣ AI retrieves and applies the previous fix
4️⃣ AI validates that the issue is resolved before deployment

✅ Reduces human intervention in debugging cycles.

📌 API-Assisted AI Interaction
📌 Currently, API endpoints allow external tools to interact with the AI Recall System.
📌 In the future, AI will self-query these endpoints automatically.

🔹 Query Stored Knowledge (/query/knowledge)
Method: POST
Example Request:

json
Copy
Edit
{
    "query": "What debugging steps were used for the last API failure?"
}
Example Response:

json
Copy
Edit
{
    "retrieved_knowledge": "The last API failure was related to a missing API key. Debugging steps included..."
}
✅ AI will eventually call this endpoint autonomously during error handling.

📌 Summary
📌 This document ensures developers can efficiently interact with AI for:
✅ Current Manual Workflows (CLI, Continue.dev, API queries)
✅ Future AI-to-AI Workflows (Autonomous debugging, self-querying memory)
✅ Seamless evolution from human-AI interaction to full AI-driven execution

### Summary:

@Codebase

Continue indexes your codebase so that it can later automatically pull in the most relevant context from throughout your workspace. This is done via a combination of embeddings-based retrieval and keyword search. By default, all embeddings are calculated locally using transformers.js and stored locally in ~/.continue/index.

transformers.js cannot be used in JetBrains
Currently, transformers.js cannot be used in JetBrains IDEs. However, you can select a differet embeddings model from the list here.

Currently, the codebase retrieval feature is available as the "codebase" and "folder" context providers. You can use them by typing @Codebase or @Folder in the input box, and then asking a question. The contents of the input box will be compared with the embeddings from the rest of the codebase (or folder) to determine relevant files.

Here are some common use cases where it can be useful:

Asking high-level questions about your codebase
"How do I add a new endpoint to the server?"
"Do we use VS Code's CodeLens feature anywhere?"
"Is there any code written already to convert HTML to markdown?"
Generate code using existing samples as reference
"Generate a new React component with a date picker, using the same patterns as existing components"
"Write a draft of a CLI application for this project using Python's argparse"
"Implement the foo method in the bar class, following the patterns seen in other subclasses of baz.
Use @Folder to ask questions about a specific folder, increasing the likelihood of relevant results
"What is the main purpose of this folder?"
"How do we use VS Code's CodeLens API?"
Or any of the above examples, but with @Folder instead of @Codebase
Here are use cases where it is not useful:

When you need the LLM to see literally every file in your codebase
"Find everywhere where the foo function is called"
"Review our codebase and find any spelling mistakes"
Refactoring
"Add a new parameter to the bar function and update usages"
Configuration
There are a few options that let you configure the behavior of the codebase context provider. These can be set in config.json, and are the same for the codebase, docs, and folder context providers:

config.json
{
  "contextProviders": [
    {
      "name": "codebase",
      "params": {
        "nRetrieve": 25,
        "nFinal": 5,
        "useReranking": true
      }
    }
  ]
}

nRetrieve
Number of results to initially retrieve from vector database (default: 25)

nFinal
Final number of results to use after re-ranking (default: 5)

useReranking
Whether to use re-ranking, which will allow initial selection of nRetrieve results, then will use an LLM to select the top nFinal results (default: true)

Ignore files during indexing
Continue respects .gitignore files in order to determine which files should not be indexed. If you'd like to exclude additional files, you can add them to a .continueignore file, which follows the exact same rules as .gitignore.

Continue also supports a global .continueignore file that will be respected for all workspaces, which can be created at ~/.continue/.continueignore.

If you want to see exactly what files Continue has indexed, the metadata is stored in ~/.continue/index/index.sqlite. You can use a tool like DB Browser for SQLite to view the tag_catalog table within this file.

If you need to force a refresh of the index, reload the VS Code window with cmd/ctrl + shift + p + "Reload Window".

Repository map
Models in the Claude 3, Llama 3.1/3.2, Gemini 1.5, and GPT-4o families will automatically use a repository map during codebase retrieval, which allows the model to understand the structure of your codebase and use it to answer questions. Currently, the repository map only contains the filepaths in the codebase.

Build your own context provider
Introductory Example
To write your own context provider, you just have to implement the CustomContextProvider interface:

interface CustomContextProvider {
  title: string;
  displayTitle?: string;
  description?: string;
  renderInlineAs?: string;
  type?: ContextProviderType;
  getContextItems(
    query: string,
    extras: ContextProviderExtras,
  ): Promise<ContextItem[]>;
  loadSubmenuItems?: (
    args: LoadSubmenuItemsArgs,
  ) => Promise<ContextSubmenuItem[]>;
}

As an example, let's say you have a set of internal documents that have been indexed in a vector database. You've set up a simple REST API that allows internal users to query and get back relevant snippets. This context provider will send the query to this server and return the results from the vector database. The return type of getContextItems must be an array of objects that have all of the following properties:

name: The name of the context item, which will be displayed as a title
description: A longer description of the context item
content: The actual content of the context item, which will be fed to the LLM as context
~/.continue/config.ts
const RagContextProvider: CustomContextProvider = {
  title: "rag",
  displayTitle: "RAG",
  description:
    "Retrieve snippets from our vector database of internal documents",

  getContextItems: async (
    query: string,
    extras: ContextProviderExtras,
  ): Promise<ContextItem[]> => {
    const response = await fetch("https://internal_rag_server.com/retrieve", {
      method: "POST",
      body: JSON.stringify({ query }),
    });

    const results = await response.json();

    return results.map((result) => ({
      name: result.title,
      description: result.title,
      content: result.contents,
    }));
  },
};

It can then be added in config.ts like so:

~/.continue/config.ts
export function modifyConfig(config: Config): Config {
  if (!config.contextProviders) {
    config.contextProviders = [];
  }
  config.contextProviders.push(RagContextProvider);
  return config;
}

No modification in config.json is necessary.

Custom Context Providers with Submenu or Query
There are 3 types of context providers: "normal", "query", and "submenu". The "normal" type is the default, and is what we've seen so far.

The "query" type is used when you want to display a text box to the user, and then use the contents of that text box to generate the context items. Built-in examples include "search" and "google". This text is what gets passed to the "query" argument in getContextItems. To implement a "query" context provider, simply set "type": "query" in your custom context provider object.

The "submenu" type is used when you want to display a list of searchable items in the dropdown. Built-in examples include "issue" and "folder". To implement a "submenu" context provider, set "type": "submenu" and implement the loadSubmenuItems and getContextItems functions. Here is an example that shows a list of all README files in the current workspace:

~/.continue/config.ts
const ReadMeContextProvider: CustomContextProvider = {
  title: "readme",
  displayTitle: "README",
  description: "Reference README.md files in your workspace",
  type: "submenu",

  getContextItems: async (
    query: string,
    extras: ContextProviderExtras,
  ): Promise<ContextItem[]> => {
    // 'query' is the filepath of the README selected from the dropdown
    const content = await extras.ide.readFile(query);
    return [
      {
        name: getFolder(query),
        description: getFolderAndBasename(query),
        content,
      },
    ];
  },

  loadSubmenuItems: async (
    args: LoadSubmenuItemsArgs,
  ): Promise<ContextSubmenuItem[]> => {
    const { ide } = args;

    // Filter all workspace files for READMEs
    const workspaceDirs = await ide.getWorkspaceDirs()

    const allFiles = await Promise.all(
      workspaceDirs.map(dir => ide.subprocess(`find ${dir} -name "README.md"`)),
    );

    // 'readmes' now contains an array of file paths for each README.md file found in the workspace,
    // excluding those in 'node_modules'
    const readmes = allFiles
      .flatMap(mds => mds[0].split("\n"))
      .filter(file => file.trim() !== '' && !file.includes("/node_modules/"))

    // Return the items that will be shown in the dropdown
    return readmes.map((filepath) => {
      return {
        id: filepath,
        title: getFolder(filepath),
        description: getFolderAndBasename(filepath),
      };
    });
  },
};

export function modifyConfig(config: Config): Config {
  if (!config.contextProviders) {
    config.contextProviders = [];
  }
  config.contextProviders.push(ReadMeContextProvider);
  return config;
}

function getFolder(path: string): string {
  return path.split(/[\/\\]/g).slice(-2)[0];
}

function getFolderAndBasename(path: string): string {
  return path
    .split(/[\/\\]/g)
    .slice(-2)
    .join("/");
}


The flow of information in the above example is as follows:

The user types @readme and selects it from the dropdown, now displaying the submenu where they can search for any item returned by loadSubmenuItems.
The user selects one of the READMEs in the submenu, enters the rest of their input, and presses enter.
The id of the chosen ContextSubmenuItem is passed to getContextItems as the query argument. In this case it is the filepath of the README.
The getContextItems function can then use the query to retrieve the full contents of the README and format the content before returning the context item which will be included in the prompt.
Importing outside modules
To include outside Node modules in your config.ts, run npm install <module_name> from the ~/.continue directory, and then import them in config.ts.

Continue will use esbuild to bundle your config.ts and any dependencies into a single Javascript file. The exact configuration used can be found here.

CustomContextProvider Reference
title: An identifier for the context provider
displayTitle (optional): The title displayed in the dropdown
description (optional): The longer description displayed in the dropdown when hovered
type (optional): The type of context provider. Options are "normal", "query", and "submenu". Defaults to "normal".
renderInlineAs (optional): The string that will be rendered inline at the top of the prompt. If no value is provided, the displayTitle will be used. An empty string can be provided to prevent rendering the default displayTitle.
getContextItems: A function that returns the documents to include in the prompt. It should return a list of ContextItems, and is given access to the following arguments:
extras.fullInput: A string representing the user's full input to the text box. This can be used for example to generate an embedding to compare against a set of other embedded documents
extras.embeddingsProvider: The embeddings provider has an embed function that will convert text (such as fullInput) to an embedding
extras.llm: The current default LLM, which you can use to make completion requests
extras.ide: An instance of the IDE class, which lets you gather various sources of information from the IDE, including the contents of the terminal, the list of open files, or any warnings in the currently open file.
query: (not currently used) A string representing the query
loadSubmenuItems (optional): A function that returns a list of ContextSubmenuItems to display in a submenu. It is given access to an IDE, the same that is passed to getContextItems.
Writing Context Providers in Other Languages
If you'd like to write a context provider in a language other than TypeScript, you can use the "http" context provider to call a server that hosts your own code. Add the context provider to config.json like this:

{
  "name": "http",
  "params": {
    "url": "https://myserver.com/context-provider",
    "title": "http",
    "description": "Custom HTTP Context Provider",
    "displayTitle": "My Custom Context",
    "options": {}
  }
}

Then, create a server that responds to requests as are made from HttpContextProvider.ts. See the hello endpoint in context_provider_server.py for an example that uses FastAPI.

The "options" property can be used to send additional parameters to your endpoint, which will be included in the request body.

Extension API for VSCode
Continue exposes an API for registering context providers from a 3rd party VSCode extension. This is useful if you have a VSCode extension that provides some additional context that you would like to use in Continue. To use this API, add the following to your package.json:

package.json
{
  "extensionDependencies": ["continue.continue"]
}

Or install the Continue Core module from npm:

npm i @continuedev/core

You can add the Continue core module as a dev dependency in your package.json:

package.json
{
  "devDependencies": {
    "@continuedev/core": "^0.0.1"
  }
}

Then, you can use the registerCustomContextProvider function to register your context provider. Your custom context provider must implement the IContextProvider interface. Here is an example:

myCustomContextProvider.ts
import * as vscode from "vscode";
import {
  IContextProvider,
  ContextProviderDescription,
  ContextProviderExtras,
  ContextItem,
  LoadSubmenuItemsArgs,
  ContextSubmenuItem,
} from "@continuedev/core";

class MyCustomProvider implements IContextProvider {
  get description(): ContextProviderDescription {
    return {
      title: "Custom",
      displayTitle: "Custom",
      description: "my custom context provider",
      type: "normal",
    };
  }

  async getContextItems(
    query: string,
    extras: ContextProviderExtras,
  ): Promise<ContextItem[]> {
    return [
      {
        name: "Custom",
        description: "Custom description",
        content: "Custom content",
      },
    ];
  }

  async loadSubmenuItems(
    args: LoadSubmenuItemsArgs,
  ): Promise<ContextSubmenuItem[]> {
    return [];
  }
}

// create an instance of your custom provider
const customProvider = new MyCustomProvider();

// get Continue extension using vscode API
const continueExt = vscode.extensions.getExtension("Continue.continue");

// get the API from the extension
const continueApi = continueExt?.exports;

// register your custom provider
continueApi?.registerCustomContextProvider(customProvider);

This will register MyCustomProvider with Continue!
```

## `knowledge_base/continueDev_documentation/continueDev_docs.md`
**File:** `continueDev_docs.md`
**Path:** `knowledge_base/continueDev_documentation/continueDev_docs.md`

### Summary:
🔹 This file is a **MD file**, containing documentation.

### Full Content:
```md
@Docs
The @Docs context provider allows you to efficiently reference locally-indexed documentation directly within Continue.

Enabling the @Docs context provider
To enable the @Docs context provider, add it to the list of context providers in your config.json file.

config.json
{
  "contextProviders": [
    {
      "name": "docs"
    }
  ]
}

How It Works
The @Docs context provider works by

Crawling specified documentation sites
Generating embeddings for the chunked content
Storing the embeddings locally on your machine
Embedding chat input to include similar documentation chunks as context
Pre-indexed Documentation Sites
In VS Code, Continue offers a selection of pre-indexed documentation sites for popular frameworks and libraries. You can view the list of available pre-indexed sites and request additions here.

Pre-indexed docs are only available in VS Code because the VS Code extension ships with the Transformers.js embedder built in, while Jetbrains currently does not. You can override a pre-indexed doc to index it with your own embeddings provider by adding it to your config (unique by startUrl). Otherwise, it will always use Transformers.js for queries.

Indexing Your Own Documentation
Through the @Docs Context Provider
To add a single documentation site, we recommend using the Add Documentation Form within the GUI. This can be accessed

from the @Docs context provider - type @Docs in the chat, hit Enter, and search for Add Docs
from the More page (three dots icon) in the @docs indexes section the @Docs context provider.
In the Add Documentation Form, enter a Title and Start URL for the site.

Title: The name of the documentation site, used for identification in the UI
Start URL: The URL where the indexing process should begin.
Indexing will begin upon submission. Progress can be viewed in the form or later in the @docs indexes section of the More page.

Documentation sources may be suggested based on package files in your repo. This currently works for Python requirements.txt files and Node.js (Javascript/Typescript) package.json files.

Packages with a valid documentation URL (with a + icon) can be clicked to immediately kick off indexing
Packages with partial information (with a pen icon) can be clicked to fill the form with the available information
Note that you can hover over the information icon to see where the package suggestion was found.
Add documentation form

Through global configuration
For bulk documentation site adds or edits, we recommend editing your global configuration file directly. Documentation sites are stored in an array within docs in your global configuration, as follows:

config.json
{
  "docs": [
    {
      "title": "Nest.js",
      "startUrl": "https://docs.nestjs.com/",
      "faviconUrl": "https://docs.nestjs.com/favicon.ico"
    }
  ]
}

See the config reference for all documentation site configuration options.

Indexing will re-sync upon saving the configuration file.

Configuration
Using Your Embeddings Provider
If you have set up an embeddings provider, @docs will use your embeddings provider. Switching embeddings providers will trigger a re-index of all documentation sites in your configuration.

Reranking
As with @Codebase context provider configuration, you can adjust the reranking behavior of the @Docs context provider with the nRetrieve, nFinal, and useReranking.

config.json
{
  "contextProviders": [
    {
      "name": "docs",
      "params": {
        "nRetrieve": 25, // The number of docs to retreive from the embeddings query
        "nFinal": 5, // The number of docs chunks to return IF reranking
        "useReranking": true // use reranking if a reranker is configured (defaults to true)
      }
    }
  ]
}


Github
The Github API rate limits public requests to 60 per hour. If you want to reliably index Github repos, you can add a github token to your config file:

config.json
{
  "contextProviders": [
    {
      "name": "docs",
      "params": {
        "githubToken": "github_..."
      }
    }
  ]
}

Local Crawling
By default, Continue crawls documentation sites using a specialized crawling service that provides the best experience for most users and documentation sites.

If your documentation is private, you can skip the default crawler and use a local crawler instead by setting useLocalCrawling to true.

config.json
{
  "docs": [
    {
      "title": "My Private Docs",
      "startUrl": "http://10.2.1.2/docs",
      "faviconUrl": "http://10.2.1.2/docs/assets/favicon.ico",
      "useLocalCrawling": true
    }
  ]
}

The default local crawler is a lightweight tool that cannot render sites that are dynamically generated using JavaScript. If your sites need to be rendered, you can enable the experimental Use Chromium for Docs Crawling feature from your User Settings Page This will download and install Chromium to ~/.continue/.utils, and use it as the local crawler.

Further notes:

If the site is only locally accessible, the default crawler will fail anyways and fall back to the local crawler. useLocalCrawling is especially useful if the URL itself is confidential.
For Github Repos this has no effect because only the Github Crawler will be used, and if the repo is private it can only be accessed with a priveleged Github token anyways.
Managing your docs indexes
You can view indexing statuses and manage your documentation sites from the @docs indexes section of the More page (three dots)

Continue does not automatically re-index your docs. Use Click to re-index to trigger a reindex for a specific source
While a site is indexing, click Cancel indexing to cancel the process
Failed indexing attempts will show an error status bar and icon
Delete a documentation site from your configuration using the trash icon
More Page @docs indexes section

You can also view the overall status of currently indexing docs from a hideable progress bar at the bottom of the chat page Documentation indexing peek

You can also use the following IDE command to force a re-index of all docs: Continue: Docs Force Re-Index.

Examples
VS Code minimal setup
The following configuration example works out of the box for VS Code. This uses the built-in embeddings provider with no reranking. Pre-indexed docs will be accessible.

config.json
  "contextProviders": [
    {
      "name": "docs",
    }
  ],
  "docs": [
    {
      "title": "Nest.js",
      "startUrl": "https://docs.nestjs.com/",
    },
  ],

Jetbrains minimal setup
Here is the equivalent minimal example for Jetbrains, which requires setting up an embeddings provider. Pre-indexed docs will not be accessible.

config.json
  "contextProviders": [
    {
      "name": "docs",
    }
  ],
  "docs": [
    {
      "title": "Nest.js",
      "startUrl": "https://docs.nestjs.com/",
    },
  ],
  "embeddingsProvider": {
    "provider": "lmstudio",
    "model": "nomic-ai/nomic-embed-text-v1.5-GGUF"
  },

Full-power setup (VS Code or Jetbrains)
The following configuration example includes:

Examples of both public and private documentation sources
A custom embeddings provider
A reranker model available, with reranking parameters customized
A Github token to enable Github crawling
config.json
{
  "contextProviders": [
    {
      "name": "docs",
      "params": {
        "githubToken": "github_...",
        "nRetrieve": 25,
        "nFinal": 5,
        "useReranking": true
      }
    }
  ],
  "docs": [
    {
      "title": "Nest.js",
      "startUrl": "https://docs.nestjs.com/"
    },
    {
      "title": "My Private Docs",
      "startUrl": "http://10.2.1.2/docs",
      "faviconUrl": "http://10.2.1.2/docs/assets/favicon.ico",
      "maxDepth": 4,
      "useLocalCrawling": true
    }
  ],
  "reranker": {
    "name": "voyage",
    "params": {
      "model": "rerank-2",
      "apiKey": "<VOYAGE_API_KEY>"
    }
  },
  "embeddingsProvider": {
    "provider": "lmstudio",
    "model": "nomic-ai/nomic-embed-text-v1.5-GGUF"
  }
}

This could also involve enabling Chromium as a backup for local documentation the User Settings Page.

This could be anything from playing games, controlling robots, predicting customer behavior, etc. \n\n2. **Environment Setup**: Depending on the problem you're solving, choose an environment where your agent will operate. It can be a simulated world or a physical one. For example, if the AI is supposed to play a video game, then its environment would be the game itself.\n\n3. **Designing the Agent**: The agent should have a state (which includes all necessary information about its current situation), an action policy (how it decides what actions to perform) and learning algorithm(s). \n\n4. **Action Policy**: This could be any rule-based, probabilistic or learned method. For example, in chess games, a simple heuristic function can determine the next move based on the current state of the board, while for complex tasks like playing Go, reinforcement learning might be needed to find an optimal policy through trial and error interactions with the environment.\n\n5. **Learning Algorithm**: This is how the AI improves over time based on its past actions. Reinforcement learning (Q-learning or Deep Q Learning) could be used in scenarios where the agent's goal is to maximize some notion of cumulative reward, while Supervised Learning can be used when you have a large number of pre-labeled examples from which to learn.\n\n6. **Evaluation**: After the model has been trained, it should be evaluated on an independent test set and its performance should be measured against defined metrics. \n\n7. **Deployment & Monitoring**: Once the model is satisfactory, it can be deployed in a live environment to make real-world decisions and continuously monitored for any deviation from expected behavior. If any deviation is found, the AI system could update its policy or learning algorithm accordingly. \n\nRemember that this is a high-level overview of designing an AI agent. Each step requires detailed study of various subtopics like reinforcement learning algorithms, neural network architectures, etc., to design the best agent for your specific use case.\n"

However, I can give you a simple example of how you might begin to implement such an API in Python using Flask and SQLAlchemy for database operations:\n\n```python\nfrom flask import Flask, request\nfrom flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy\nimport uuid\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\napp.config[\"SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI\"] = \"your-database-uri\"\ndb = SQLAlchemy(app)\n\nclass FeatureRequest(db.Model):\n    id = db.Column(db.String, primary_key=True, default=lambda: str(uuid.uuid4()))  # generate UUID\n    title = db.Column(db.String(80), nullable=False)\n    description = db.Column(db.Text, nullable=False)\n\n@app.route(\"/feature_request\", methods=[\"POST\"])\ndef create_feature_request():\n    title = request.json.get(\"title\")\n    description = request.json.get(\"description\")\n    \n    if not title or not description:\n        return {\"error\": \"Missing required parameters\"}, 400\n\n    feature_request = FeatureRequest(title=title, description=description)\n    db.session.add(feature_request)\n    db.session.commit()\n\n    return {\"id\": feature_request.id}, 201\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    app.run(debug=True)\n```\n\nThis code creates a new Flask application, sets up a database connection using SQLAlchemy, and then defines an API endpoint at `/feature_request` that accepts POST requests with JSON bodies containing both a title and description for the feature request. It generates a unique id for each feature request and stores it in a database table (here, represented as a Python class) called FeatureRequest.\n\nPlease note that you need to replace \"your-database-uri\" with your actual database URI. \n\nAlso, this is a basic example of how to create an API endpoint. In reality, the process would be much more complex and involve additional considerations like error handling, security measures (like authentication/authorization), data validation, rate limiting etc. Also, in real-world scenarios, you will need to have AI integrated into your application which is a separate task.\n"

The API uses the Flask web framework in Python.\n\nHere are the major components of the API:\n\n1. **Book Model:** Defines a `Book` class with attributes like `title`, `author`, and `price`.\n2. **API Endpoints:** Provides endpoints for CRUD operations:\n\t* `GET /books`: Retrieves all books.\n\t* `POST /books`: Creates a new book.\n\t* `GET /books/:id`: Retrieves a specific book by its ID.\n\t* `PUT /books/:id`: Updates an existing book.\n\t* `DELETE /books/:id`: Deletes a book.\n\n**Improvement Suggestions:**\n\n1. **Error Handling:** Implement proper error handling using Flask's built-in `errorhandler` decorator or custom error handlers. This will help handle errors and provide meaningful responses to clients.\n2. **Input Validation:** Validate input data (e.g., book title, author, price) to prevent potential security vulnerabilities like SQL injection or cross-site scripting (XSS).\n3. **Authentication and Authorization:** Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms to restrict access to certain endpoints or resources based on user roles or permissions.\n4. **Data Persistence:** Use a database or an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool like SQLAlchemy to persist data instead of using a simple in-memory list. This will provide better data integrity, scalability, and query capabilities.\n5. **API Documentation:** Generate API documentation using tools like Swagger or Docstrings to make the API more discoverable and user-friendly.\n6. **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse and protect against excessive requests from a single client or IP address.\n7. **Caching:** Utilize caching mechanisms (e.g., Flask-Cache) to improve performance by reducing the number of database queries and speeding up response times for frequently accessed data.\n8. **Code Organization:** Refactor code organization to make it more modular, readable, and maintainable. Consider separating concerns into different files or modules.\n9. **Logging and Monitoring:** Integrate logging and monitoring tools (e.g., Loggly, Datadog) to track API performance, errors, and other important metrics.\n\n**Additional Ideas:**\n\n1. Implement search functionality for books based on title, author, or genre.\n2. Provide filtering options for retrieving specific book lists (e.g., by price range, release date).\n3. Integrate with social media platforms or other external services to retrieve book recommendations or ratings.\n4. Offer subscription-based access to premium content or features.\n\nThese suggestions should help improve the API implementation and provide a more robust, scalable, and user-friendly experience for clients."

        "response": "As an AI model, I don't have the capability to run real unit tests or interact with your code directly. However, I can guide you on how to approach this task. \n\nThe general idea is that unit tests are designed to ensure that a function (or method) does what it should do. You will test individual components in isolation from other parts of the system. For example, if you have an AI model that generates text given some input data, your unit tests might look something like this:\n\n1. Test Input/Output Type Consistency: Make sure that the output type is consistent with what you expect it to be (in Python, for example, a string). This ensures that you're not getting an integer where one would be expected.\n   \n2. Test Correctness of Output: Ensure that the output is correct based on the input data provided. If your function is supposed to return a capitalized version of the input string, make sure it does so accurately for every possible test case.\n\n3. Edge Cases: You should also consider edge cases - what happens if you pass an empty string? A string that's entirely made up of punctuation or whitespace? What about NULL values? \n\n4. Test Performance/Speed: If your function is supposed to generate output quickly, ensure this is the case in a unit test.\n\n5. Repeatability: The same input should always produce the same output. This ensures that your function is deterministic and doesn't have hidden dependencies or state that could change between runs.\n\nHere's some pseudo code on how you might do this with Python:\n\n```python\nimport unittest\nfrom my_api import generate_text  # assuming `generate_text` is the function in question\n\nclass TestGenerateText(unittest.TestCase):\n    def test_output_type(self):\n        result = generate_text('input')\n        self.assertIsInstance(result, str)\n    \n    def test_correctness(self):\n        # assuming 'input' should produce 'Output', replace with actual output for your function\n        self.assertEqual(generate_text('input'), 'Output')  \n        \n    def test_edge_cases(self):\n        result = generate_text('')\n        self.assertTrue(result in ['', 'Default Response'])  # depending on how your API handles this\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    unittest.main()\n```\nThis is a simple example and may need to be adjusted according to the complexity of your function or API. The best practice is to have separate unit tests for each small part of your code (like one test file per module), and to run all these tests regularly before deploying new code, ideally automatically as part of your continuous integration process.\n"

- If no match → Move to Step 2.

## **🔹 Step 2: Analyze Stack Trace & Error Logs**
- Extract key error messages from logs.
- Compare error with function signature.
- Determine **if failure is environment-specific or systemic.**

## **🔹 Step 3: Suggest Possible Fixes**
- Reference past successful resolutions.
- If issue is new → Generate fresh hypothesis.
- If fix is applied, **record new solution in ChromaDB for future recall.**

## **🔹 Example Query**
```plaintext
ai-debug "502 Bad Gateway in compliance-check API"

✅ **Now AI debugging isn’t just reactive—it’s structured and learnable.**

- **It will remember:** Past implementations, debugging history, feature discussions, architecture decisions, and problem-solving approaches.  
- **It will retrieve:** The most relevant information based on semantic search, ensuring solutions are always accessible.  
- **It will improve over time:** Learning from past work to make better suggestions.  

**This will act as an AI-powered Second Brain for software development.**  

---

### **2️⃣ Is this tool meant for personal use, a team, or as a SaaS?**  
📌 The system will initially be **personal** (for solo developers or small teams), allowing for fast iteration and testing.  

✅ The first version will run **locally** with optional cloud integration.  
✅ Long-term, it can be extended into a **multi-user SaaS**, where teams can collaborate on AI-powered recall and debugging.  
✅ Future versions may include **team-based memory sharing**, where AI retains project history across an entire engineering team.  

---

### **3️⃣ What are the key pain points this system solves?**  
📌 The biggest pain points in software development that this system solves include:  

- **Forgetting past solutions** → AI will instantly recall **relevant functions, fixes, and documentation.**  
- **Rewriting the same code across projects** → AI **suggests past implementations** from other projects.  
- **Losing track of debugging progress** → AI **logs every failure, resolution attempt, and fix** for future reference.  
- **Context switching inefficiencies** → AI **stores relevant knowledge across multiple projects**, reducing redundant research.  

This system ensures that **nothing important is lost and every problem solved once can be applied again.**  

---

### **4️⃣ Do you want AI to actively suggest solutions, or passively retrieve information?**  
📌 AI should do both, depending on the context.  

✅ **Active Suggestion Mode** (Default in IDE):  
- AI proactively **suggests solutions while writing code**.  
- AI **retrieves related functions or debugging fixes** based on the current code.  

✅ **Passive Retrieval Mode** (CLI Queries):  
- AI **only responds when explicitly asked via the CLI**.  
- The user queries AI for past solutions, architecture decisions, or debugging history.  

🔹 The AI **should adapt based on the user’s workflow**, but always provide **context-aware** assistance.  

---

### **5️⃣ Is this project meant to be self-contained, or part of a broader system?**  
📌 The AI recall system is **a foundational component that can be expanded** into multiple applications.  

- Initially, it will be **self-contained**, running locally with all knowledge stored on the developer’s machine.  
- In the long term, it will **connect to external knowledge bases** (GitHub repos, Stack Overflow, API documentation, etc.).  
- It can evolve into **a broader AI development workflow engine**, assisting in project creation, automation, and deployment.  

**The goal is to start small and scalable, ensuring modular extensibility.**  

---

## **Step 2: Defining the Core Features**  

### **6️⃣ What are the three most important features this system should have?**  
📌 The system must provide **AI-powered recall, structured debugging history, and cross-project awareness.**  

1️⃣ **📂 AI-Powered Recall**  
   - AI **instantly retrieves past solutions** based on similarity to the current task.  
   - Knowledge base supports **semantic search, prioritizing recency & relevance.**  

2️⃣ **🛠️ AI-Assisted Debugging Memory**  
   - AI **tracks error logs, failed API calls, and troubleshooting steps** for instant recall.  
   - AI suggests **fixes based on past debugging logs.**  

3️⃣ **🔄 Cross-Project Awareness**  
   - AI **references solutions across multiple projects** and interlinks them.  
   - **Mirrors knowledge bases** into a `knowledge_base_global/` for global recall.  

---

### **7️⃣ Should AI-assisted debugging be a priority, or should we focus on knowledge recall first?**  
📌 **Knowledge recall should come first, followed by debugging.**  

1️⃣ **Phase 1:** Implement **fast AI retrieval of stored solutions & past implementations.**  
2️⃣ **Phase 2:** Expand into **AI-powered debugging, error tracking, and logging.**  
3️⃣ **Phase 3:** Integrate **real-time AI assistance inside the IDE.**  

🚀 **This ensures AI can retrieve useful knowledge first, then apply that knowledge to debugging & troubleshooting.**  

---

### **8️⃣ Will this system integrate with VS Code, a CLI, or a web interface?**  
📌 Initially, this system will be **CLI-based**, allowing developers to retrieve information via terminal commands.  

```bash
ai-recall "How did we solve rate limiting before?"

✅ Once the core functionality is working, we will integrate with VS Code via Continue.dev for real-time AI suggestions.

Long-term, a web dashboard could allow for visualization of AI-assisted debugging history & knowledge graphs.

9️⃣ Do you need this to work across multiple machines, or just locally?
📌 Local-first, with potential for multi-device support.

✅ First version: Everything is stored locally for fast access.
✅ Later versions: Optional cloud synchronization to allow multi-machine access.
✅ Team-based SaaS version: Allows multiple developers to share an AI memory graph.

Step 3: Defining How AI Should Retrieve Information
🔟 How should information be retrieved? Should we prioritize recent knowledge over older data?
📌 AI retrieval should be semantic and context-aware, prioritizing recently used or referenced knowledge.

✅ Ranking Criteria for AI Retrieval:
1️⃣ Most recently modified or referenced files are prioritized.
2️⃣ Closest semantic match is returned first.
3️⃣ Past debugging attempts for the same error or issue are prioritized.

11️⃣ Should retrieval be semantic (meaning-based) or strictly keyword-driven?
📌 Retrieval should be primarily semantic, with keyword fallback.

Semantic search ensures AI pulls the most relevant insights even if phrasing is different.
Keyword fallback ensures that exact file names, function names, or API calls can still be retrieved.
🚀 The combination of both ensures accuracy and flexibility.

12️⃣ Should AI store every iteration of changes, or just the final version?
📌 AI should track meaningful changes, not every minor edit.

✅ Store major iterations & debugging resolutions.
✅ Track failed API calls & troubleshooting logs.
✅ Limit excessive storage of minor edits to avoid cluttering retrieval results.

🚀 This keeps AI recall useful without overwhelming search results.

Step 4: Long-Term Vision & Future Growth
13️⃣ What do we want this system to be capable of in 6 months?
📌 An AI-assisted development memory system that actively improves coding efficiency.

✅ Instant retrieval of past solutions across all projects.
✅ AI-assisted debugging with structured recall of past failures & fixes.
✅ Real-time VS Code integration for seamless AI-enhanced coding.

14️⃣ Should AI eventually automate parts of coding, or just assist in recall?
📌 AI should start as a recall tool but gradually assist in refactoring and feature generation.

🚀 The long-term goal is a self-improving AI-powered development assistant.

| `AI_architecture_notes.md` | Technical breakdown of AI agents, pipelines, and decision-making models. |

✔️ **AI Behavior:**  
- When answering a query, AI first **checks this directory for relevant knowledge.**  
- If **no relevant information is found**, the AI then queries DeepSeek.

---

## **📂 `code_base/`**
📍 `/mnt/f/projects/ai-recall-system/code_base/`
💡 **Purpose:** Stores **all Python scripts**, both manually created and AI-generated.

| File Name                  | Description |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `core_architecture.py`      | Main AI pipeline & knowledge processing logic. |

2️⃣ **AI generates test cases based on real-world scenarios.**  
3️⃣ **Execution logs are stored in `testing_logs/`.**  
4️⃣ **AI summarizes test failures & suggests fixes.**  

## **🔹 AI-Generated Testing Log Format**
🔹 Test Name: [Brief Description]
🔹 Function Being Tested: [Function Name]
🔹 Test Cases Run: [Number of test cases]
🔹 Success Rate: [Passed X out of Y cases]
🔹 Failed Cases (if any):
- Test Input: [Failed Input]
- Expected Output: [What Should Have Happened]
- Actual Output: [What Happened Instead]
- Suggested Fix: [What AI Thinks Should Be Changed]
- Suggested Fix: [What AI Thinks Should Be Changed]

# 2-12 work summary

Refined my agent_manager.py and multi_agent_workflow.py, solved issues w debug logging:

✅ **AI now correctly references the affected script (`test_api_handler.py`).**

✅ **AI successfully extracts and suggests a relevant Python fix.**

✅ **Fixes are being properly logged in `debug_logs.json`.**

✅ **Fixes are explicitly linked to their original errors (`original_log_id`).**

✅ **AI-generated fixes are stored in a clean, raw Python format (without Markdown artifacts).**

🚀 **One Final Consideration Before Moving On:**

📌 **Do we want AI to automatically test its own fixes after applying them?**

💡 **Example of How This Could Work:**

- AI applies a fix.
- **Immediately after applying the fix, it runs a test** to check if the original error still occurs.
- If the fix works, AI **updates `fix_successful: true`** in `debug_logs.json`.
- If the fix fails, AI **generates an alternative fix and retries.**

### **🔥 Summary of Our Current State**

✅ **AI-generated fixes are accurate, logged properly, and stored without formatting artifacts.**

✅ **Errors and fixes are explicitly linked using `original_log_id`.**

✅ **Debugging recall is functional and properly structured.**

✅ **AI successfully references the script before generating a fix.**

🚨 **Remaining Question:** **Do we move forward now, or do we first implement an automated fix verification step?**

### **🔥 Should We Generate a Large Test Set & Run AI on All of It?**

📌 **Short Answer:** **Yes, but not right now.**

- Creating **50+ test scripts** and running AI across them would be **extremely valuable** for stress-testing.
- However, **it’s overkill at this stage.**

🚀 **When We Should Do This:**

- Once **we've fully validated AI debugging, logging, and fix verification.**
- **After we refine `debugging_strategy.py`**, since that may change how we test fixes.
- When we’re ready for **batch testing & performance evaluation** across many cases.

📌 **For Now, We Can Just Note This As a Future Task.**

### **🔥 What Would `debugging_strategy.py` Look Like?**

🚀 **High-Level Plan:**

✅ **A central place to manage AI-driven debugging techniques.**

✅ **Tracks debugging strategies and success rates over time.**

✅ **Allows AI to determine the best debugging approach based on previous fixes.**

### **🔥 Game Plan for `debugging_strategy.py` – Execution & Validation**

🚀 **What We Need to Accomplish:**

✅ **AI should retrieve the best debugging strategy for an error type.**

✅ **AI should update debugging strategies based on success/failure of applied fixes.**

✅ **AI should analyze past logs (`debug_logs.json`) and adapt over time.**

✅ **Ensure AI debugging recall is actually improving, not just storing data.**

## **📌 What Needs to Be Tested?**

### **✅ Test 1: Debugging Strategy Retrieval**

🔹 **Goal:** Confirm AI retrieves a **valid debugging strategy** when asked.

🔹 **How?**

1️⃣ **Add past fixes to `debugging_strategy_log.json`.**

2️⃣ **Ask AI for a strategy for a known error type.**

3️⃣ **Check if the suggested strategy aligns with what has worked before.**

### **✅ Test 2: Debugging Strategy Updates**

🔹 **Goal:** Ensure AI **updates debugging strategies based on fix success.**

🔹 **How?**

1️⃣ **Simulate an error & apply a fix.**

2️⃣ **Confirm that AI logs the fix in `debugging_strategy_log.json`.**

3️⃣ **Check if AI increases the success rate of effective debugging strategies.**

### **✅ Test 3: AI Learns from Past Debugging Logs**

🔹 **Goal:** Ensure AI **analyzes `debug_logs.json` and adjusts its debugging approach.**

🔹 **How?**

1️⃣ **Run AI with past logs containing multiple errors & fixes.**

2️⃣ **Check if AI extracts debugging patterns from previous fixes.**

3️⃣ **Verify that AI modifies debugging suggestions based on what worked in past logs.**

## **📌 What Test Files Do We Need?**

📌 **No new test scripts required.**

✅ **We will rely on `debug_logs.json` and `debugging_strategy_log.json`** for tracking.

✅ **All necessary error cases are already in our system.**

### **🔥 Debugging Strategy Log Review – Are We Good to Move On?**

🚀 **This is exactly what we needed to confirm.**

📌 **What This Log Confirms:**

✅ **AI successfully tracks debugging strategies** for different error types.

✅ **Each strategy includes:**

- `"error_type"` → What the error was.
- `"strategy"` → The AI-generated fix that worked.
- `"attempts"` → How many times AI tried this fix.
- `"successful_fixes"` → How many times the fix worked.
- `"success_rate"` → AI now prioritizes high-success-rate fixes.✅ **AI correctly ranks debugging strategies based on `"success_rate": 1.0`.**✅ **AI is choosing the most effective past solution when asked for a strategy.**

### **📌 What’s Working Well?**

✅ **AI now learns from past debugging attempts and optimizes its approach.**

✅ **Debugging recall is now more than just logging—it actively improves over time.**

✅ **Fixes are now stored, ranked, and retrieved dynamically based on success rates.**

---

### **📌 Are We Ready to Move to the Next Phase?**

**YES.**

🚀 **Everything is structured correctly, AI is learning from past debugging efforts, and strategies are being ranked based on effectiveness.**

### **🔥 Sprint Review – Are We Staying on Track?**

✅ **We are adhering to the Sprint structure without unnecessary scope creep.**

✅ **We successfully transitioned from debugging recall to AI-driven strategy tracking.**

🔹 **We made incredible progress in debugging recall, logging fixes, and AI strategy tracking, but:**

1️⃣ **We haven’t built `work_session.md` logging yet.**

2️⃣ **We haven’t separated debugging logs by project (even if it's just one project for now).**

3️⃣ **We need to ensure AI can recall previous errors and fixes *before* suggesting new solutions.**

### **📌 Sprint Week 1: What Have We Completed?**

| **Task** | **Status** | **Notes** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ✅ **Task 1: Evaluate Codebase & Define Core Single-Agent Scripts** | **Partially Done** | **Modified `multi_agent_workflow.py` and created `debugging_strategy.py`.** However, we need to validate that we’ve fully defined **all necessary scripts** for Single-Agent Mode. |
| ✅ **Task 2: Implement Core Knowledge Recall** | **Mostly Done** | AI **remembers past debugging history, retrieves fixes, and learns from previous logs.** However, **we haven’t structured a full work session log (`work_session.md`) for tracking.** |
| 🔲 **Task 3: Debugging Recall & Self-Tracking System** | **Partially Done** | We log AI-generated fixes, but AI does not yet **differentiate debugging logs by project.** Also, we need to ensure AI recalls **previous errors and fixes before suggesting new solutions.** |
| 🔲 **Task 4: Implement Work Session Logs & AI Recall** | **Not Done** | We haven’t implemented **structured `work_session.md` logging, timestamped session entries, or recall queries for different time intervals.** |

February 12, 2025 3:26 PM Choosing path forward, current state:

### **📌 Why is Task 4 Faster?**

🔹 **Work Session Logging (`work_session.md`) is straightforward.**

- **Simply tracking session timestamps, logs, and actions.**
- **We don't need AI recall logic yet—just structured logging.**
- **A quick script can append session logs and retrieve past entries.**

🔹 **Debugging Recall (Task 3) is more involved.**

- AI **needs to retrieve past debugging attempts before suggesting new fixes.**
- **We need to design project separation** (even if for a single project now).
- **Requires ensuring AI properly differentiates logs across debugging sessions.**

---

### **🔥 Next Move: Let’s Knock Out Task 4 (Work Session Logging)**

🚀 **We Will:**

✅ **Create `work_session.md` for structured session logging.**

✅ **Build a script (`work_session_logger.py`) to log AI work sessions.**

✅ **Enable retrieval of past session summaries by different time intervals.**

### **🔥 AI Work Session (`work_session.md`)  Summarization – Are We Done?**

🚀 **Success! The AI-generated summary is structured and readable.**

📌 **What This Confirms:**

✅ **AI correctly processes past work sessions.**

✅ **Summaries are structured and include:**

- **Tasks Completed**
- **Problems Encountered**
- **Unresolved Issues**
    - ✅ **Summarization runs without connection failures or timeouts.**

### **📌 Is This Summary Format Good Enough?**

✅ **Yes, this structure is functional and provides clear recall.**

🔹 **Possible Refinement (Later):** We could format the summary better for readability and ensure AI captures more technical details, but this isn’t essential right now.

Circling back to Task 3 and refining debug retrieval/parsing:

### **📌 Anything That Still Needs Improvement?**

🔹 **Issue #1: AI Still Outputs Markdown Backticks (````python ... ````) in `debug_logs.json`**

- Example: `"fix_attempted": "```python\ndef authenticate_user(user_data): ...```"`
- **Fix:** Ensure Markdown formatting is stripped before writing to logs.

🔹 **Issue #2: AI Fix Iteration Could Provide a Comparison Between Failed Fix and New Fix**

- Right now, when AI retries a failed fix, it **does not state how the new fix differs from the previous one.**
- **Fix:** AI should explicitly state what changes were made in the alternative solution.
```

# Inventory_Report

## **📌 Codebase Categorization**

Below is a **categorized breakdown of my scripts** based on their function.

| **Category** | **Scripts** | **Action Plan** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Active (Core to Single-Agent Mode)** | `agent_manager.py`, `api_structure.py`, `core_architecture.py`, `user_interaction_flow.py` | ✅ **Essential for AI recall, debugging, and execution workflows. No changes needed yet.** |
| **Modified (Needs Refinement for Single-Agent Mode)** | `multi_agent_workflow.py`, `debugging_strategy.py`, `generate_debug_report.py`, `store_markdown_in_chroma.py` | ✍️ **Needs to be adjusted for Single-Agent Mode without Multi-Agent complexity.** |
| **Archived (Not needed for now, but may be useful later)** | `generate_api_structure.py`, `generate_core_architecture.py`, `generate_roadmap.py`, `generate_user_interaction.py`, `update_roadmap.py` | 🗄 **Move these to `archive/` to avoid confusion in this phase.** |

🚀 **Goal for Today:**

📌 **We need to refine "Modified" scripts for Single-Agent Mode before implementing AI recall and debugging.**

## **📌 Quick Assessment: What Needs Changing?**

Below is a **breakdown of each script and the key modifications required.**

| **Script** | **Current Purpose** | **Issues for Single-Agent Mode** | **Modifications Needed** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **`multi_agent_workflow.py`** | Orchestrates multi-agent collaboration for AI workflows. | ❌ Designed for multiple agents (Architect, Engineer, QA, etc.), which we aren’t using yet. | ✅ **Strip all multi-agent logic** and refactor it into a **single recall-debug loop.** |
| **`debugging_strategy.py`** | Defines AI debugging recall methodology. | ⚠️ Some logic assumes multiple AI agents. | ✅ **Ensure the strategy focuses on single-agent AI retrieving & applying debugging solutions.** |
| **`generate_debug_report.py`** | Generates structured debugging logs for past errors. | ⚠️ Some multi-agent references. | ✅ **Ensure debug reports only track single-agent execution (not agent-to-agent collaboration).** |
| **`store_markdown_in_chroma.py`** | Indexes `.md` knowledge into ChromaDB for retrieval. | ⚠️ No major issues, but may need **verification** to ensure it’s indexing correctly. | ✅ **Confirm it indexes properly and integrates into AI recall.** |

### **Current Purpose Review for Non-Modified Scripts**

While we already evaluated the 4 scripts for modification, **we should at least document the purpose of all other scripts** so we have a **full inventory**.

| **Script** | **Current Purpose** | **Category** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `agent_manager.py` | Manages AI agents for execution and task delegation. | **Active** |
| `api_structure.py` | Handles API interactions between Flask and AI models. | **Active** |
| `bootstrap_scan.py` | Scans the knowledge base and logs findings. | **Active** |
| `generate_knowledge_base.py` | Populates AI agent knowledge bases with structured `.md` documentation. | **Active** |
| `map_project_structure.py` | Generates a structured JSON output of the project directory. | **Active** |
| `generate_project_dump.py` | Extracts and saves the full project file structure. | **Active** |
| `generate_project_summary.py` | Creates a high-level summary of all project files. | **Active** |
| `generate_work_summary.py` | Logs AI-assisted work sessions and retrieves them. | **Active** |

### **Confirm Core Scripts for Single-Agent Mode**

📌 **Final list of scripts that will be actively used in Single-Agent Mode:**
