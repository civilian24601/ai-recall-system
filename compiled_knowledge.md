# 🤖 AI Coding Guidelines  

## **📌 Overview**  

This document defines the **coding standards & best practices** for AI-generated code in the AI Recall System.  

🚀 **Primary Goals:**  
✅ **Ensure AI writes modular, readable, and maintainable code**  
✅ **Standardize AI-generated function structures and documentation**  
✅ **Prevent AI from introducing redundant or inefficient logic**  
✅ **Guide AI-assisted debugging and code self-refactoring processes**  

---

## **📌 1. AI Code Generation Best Practices**  

📌 **AI-generated code must follow a structured format to ensure readability and maintainability.**  

### **🔹 Required Structure for AI-Generated Functions**

✅ **Every function must have a clear docstring describing its purpose and parameters.**  
✅ **AI must include inline comments for complex logic.**  
✅ **Variable names should be descriptive and follow `snake_case`.**  

📌 **Example AI-Generated Function:**

```python
def fetch_latest_debug_logs(limit: int = 5) -> list:
    """
    Retrieves the latest debugging logs from ChromaDB.

    Args:
        limit (int): Number of logs to retrieve.

    Returns:
        list: A list of debugging log entries.
    """
    logs = query_chroma_db("SELECT * FROM debug_logs ORDER BY timestamp DESC LIMIT ?", [limit])
    return logs
✅ This ensures AI-generated code is readable, well-documented, and reusable.

📌 2. AI Self-Refactoring Guidelines
📌 AI must follow strict validation steps when refactoring code to prevent unintended changes.

🔹 AI Refactoring Workflow
1️⃣ Retrieve previous versions of the function from ChromaDB.
2️⃣ Analyze performance & redundancy before refactoring.
3️⃣ Apply changes incrementally and verify against test cases.
4️⃣ Log modifications for future AI recall.

📌 Example AI Refactoring Validation:

python
Copy
Edit
def validate_refactored_code(old_code: str, new_code: str) -> bool:
    """
    Compares old and new code to ensure refactoring improved performance and readability.

    Args:
        old_code (str): Original function code.
        new_code (str): Refactored function code.

    Returns:
        bool: True if changes are valid, False otherwise.
    """
    if len(new_code) < len(old_code) * 0.9:  # Ensure refactor does not introduce unnecessary complexity
        return False

    return True  # If refactor passes validation, return True
✅ Prevents AI from making unnecessary modifications that worsen code quality.

📌 3. Debugging & Error Handling Standards
📌 AI must follow a structured debugging approach when identifying & fixing errors.

🔹 AI Debugging Workflow
✅ Step 1: AI logs detected errors in debug_logs.json.
✅ Step 2: AI retrieves past debugging solutions before suggesting a fix.
✅ Step 3: AI applies the fix (if in self-debugging mode) or recommends the change to the user.

📌 Example AI Debugging Entry

json
Copy
Edit
{
    "timestamp": "2025-02-10 14:23:11",
    "error": "SQL Integrity Constraint Violation",
    "fix_applied": "Added unique constraint to the schema.",
    "developer_reviewed": true
}
✅ Ensures AI debugging recall is structured and reliable.

📌 4. AI Code Review & Validation Process
📌 All AI-generated code must be validated before execution.

🔹 AI Code Review Checklist
✔ Function structure follows defined best practices.
✔ Variables and function names are descriptive and consistent.
✔ No redundant or unnecessary loops introduced.
✔ Changes do not impact system performance negatively.

📌 Example AI Code Review Process:

python
Copy
Edit
def review_ai_generated_code(code_snippet: str) -> bool:
    """
    Reviews AI-generated code to ensure it follows best practices.

    Args:
        code_snippet (str): AI-generated Python function.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the code is valid, False otherwise.
    """
    if "def " not in code_snippet or '"""' not in code_snippet:
        return False  # Ensure function has a docstring

    if "for " in code_snippet and "while " in code_snippet:
        return False  # Ensure AI does not introduce unnecessary loops

    return True
✅ Prevents AI from introducing low-quality or redundant code.

📌 5. ChromaDB Integration for AI Code Recall
📌 AI retrieves stored coding patterns & debugging solutions before writing new code.

🔹 AI Knowledge Retrieval Workflow
1️⃣ Query ChromaDB for past function implementations.
2️⃣ Compare retrieved results against the current task.
3️⃣ Modify existing solutions before generating entirely new code.

📌 Example ChromaDB Query for AI Code Retrieval

python
Copy
Edit
def query_ai_codebase(search_term: str) -> list:
    """
    Queries ChromaDB for AI-generated code snippets related to the search term.

    Args:
        search_term (str): The keyword to search for.

    Returns:
        list: A list of matching code snippets.
    """
    results = query_chroma_db(f"SELECT snippet FROM codebase WHERE description LIKE '%{search_term}%'")
    return results
✅ Ensures AI reuses stored knowledge instead of generating redundant solutions.

    """
    logs = query_chroma_db("SELECT * FROM debug_logs ORDER BY timestamp DESC LIMIT ?", [limit])
    return logs
✅ This ensures AI-generated code is structured, documented, and follows best practices.

📌 2. AI Debugging & Execution Best Practices
📌 AI debugging recall & execution must follow structured retrieval and validation protocols.

🔹 AI Debugging Workflow
✅ Step 1: AI retrieves debugging logs before generating new fixes.
✅ Step 2: AI prioritizes past solutions that were successfully applied.
✅ Step 3: AI ranks solutions based on confidence and context relevance.
✅ Step 4: AI suggests or applies the highest-confidence fix.

📌 Example AI Debugging Retrieval Execution:


ai-debug "Retrieve last 3 debugging sessions."
🔹 AI Response Example:


[DEBUG LOG: 2025-02-10]
Error: SQL Integrity Constraint Violation
Fix Applied: Added unique constraint in schema.
Confidence Score: 98%
✅ Prevents redundant debugging attempts and optimizes AI problem-solving efficiency.

📌 3. AI Knowledge Retrieval & ChromaDB Best Practices
📌 AI retrieval logic must prioritize accuracy, context relevance, and structured storage.

🔹 AI Query Execution Guidelines
✅ AI must first check ChromaDB for previous solutions before generating new ones.
✅ AI should rank retrieved solutions based on success rates and context similarity.
✅ AI should log every retrieval attempt and its effectiveness for self-improvement.

📌 Example AI Knowledge Query Execution:


def retrieve_past_solution(query: str) -> list:
    """
    Queries ChromaDB for stored past solutions related to the given query.

    Args:
        query (str): Description of the issue.

    Returns:
        list: Retrieved solutions ranked by confidence score.
    """
    return query_chroma_db(f"SELECT solution FROM work_logs WHERE issue LIKE '%{query}%' ORDER BY confidence DESC LIMIT 3")
✅ Ensures AI queries prioritize relevant, high-confidence solutions before proposing fixes.

📌 4. AI Self-Refactoring & Code Optimization Best Practices
📌 AI self-refactoring should be efficient, performance-aware, and prevent unnecessary complexity.

🔹 AI Code Optimization Workflow
✅ AI must compare past optimized code snippets before modifying existing code.
✅ AI should refactor functions for efficiency without affecting core logic.
✅ AI should validate refactored code against test cases before execution.

📌 Example AI Refactoring Validation:

def validate_refactored_code(old_code: str, new_code: str) -> bool:
    """
    Validates AI-generated refactored code against best practices.

    Args:
        old_code (str): Original function.
        new_code (str): Refactored function.

    Returns:
        bool: True if changes improve performance, False otherwise.
    """
    if len(new_code) > len(old_code) * 1.2:  # Ensure AI does not overcomplicate logic
        return False

    return True
✅ Prevents AI from introducing redundant abstractions or unnecessary complexity.

📌 5. AI Execution & Oversight Best Practices
📌 AI execution workflows must follow validation steps before modifying core project files.

🔹 AI Execution Safety Guidelines
✅ AI requires human confirmation before applying critical code changes.
✅ AI logs all executed modifications for rollback and review.
✅ AI must validate the success rate of past modifications before proposing similar changes.

📌 Example AI Execution Oversight:


def ai_execution_guardrail(modification: str) -> bool:
    """
    AI execution guardrail to validate if a modification should be applied.

    Args:
        modification (str): AI-generated code modification.

    Returns:
        bool: True if modification is safe, False otherwise.
    """
    risk_score = assess_code_change_risk(modification)
    return risk_score < 10  # Only allow low-risk changes
✅ Prevents AI from making unintended modifications without validation.

📌 Summary
📌 This document provides structured AI best practices for:
✅ AI-generated code formatting, structure, and readability
✅ Debugging recall & execution workflows to optimize efficiency
✅ ChromaDB-powered AI knowledge retrieval & validation
✅ AI self-refactoring & optimization processes for continuous improvement

# future_proofing
<a name="futureproofing"></a>

# **Future Proofing - AI Recall System**

This document provides guidelines and best practices to ensure the **AI Recall System** (and any associated workflows) remain adaptable over the next 1–2 years and beyond. The AI field moves quickly, so these strategies emphasize **layered design**, **modular architecture**, and **open standards** to accommodate new models, tools, and expansions as they arise.

---

## **1. Modular, Layered Architecture**

A future-proof system often separates concerns into distinct layers that can be swapped or upgraded independently:

1. **Data Layer**
   - Store logs, code references, debug records, and metadata in open formats (e.g. JSON, Markdown).
   - Keep a consistent schema for debugging logs and code references to ensure easy migration if you switch database engines.

2. **Core Logic / Domain Layer**
   - Encapsulate how the system ingests logs, references code, triggers recalls, etc.
   - Avoid tying logic too closely to a single LLM or vector database.
   - Example: Provide methods like `store_debug_log()`, `retrieve_past_solution()`, or `update_knowledge()` that remain stable, even if your LLM or DB changes.

3. **Model / AI Layer**
   - Create an abstraction for LLM calls—e.g., `run_llm(prompt)`—so you can change from GPT-4 to Llama 2 or Mistral with minimal disruption.
   - Keep prompt templates and chain logic in a separate module or config so it’s easy to update or fine-tune.

4. **Presentation Layer**
   - Any CLIs, web dashboards, or Slack integrations are decoupled from the internal recall logic.
   - You can experiment with new UIs or integrate with different editors (VS Code, JetBrains) without a major refactor.

By cleanly separating these concerns, your system can evolve or integrate new AI tech without an entire rebuild.

---

## **2. Abstract Dependencies & Use Open Formats**

**Abstract Away External Tools**  

- Wrap vector database calls and LLM calls in your own interfaces (e.g. `VectorStore` interface, `LLMService` interface).  
- Minimizes changes if you later adopt a different vector DB or switch from OpenAI to another model provider.

**Open-Source & Open Standards**  

- Prefer Markdown, JSON, or YAML for storing knowledge, logs, blueprint documents.  
- If you use a vector DB (Chroma, Weaviate, Postgres+pgvector), ensure you can export / import easily.  
- Rely on commonly used libraries with large community support (e.g., Python, Docker) to avoid vendor lock-in.

---

## **3. Summarization & Tiered Memory**

Over time, you will accumulate a *lot* of logs, code snippets, blueprint files, etc. Plan for **tiered memory**:

1. **Short-Term / Active Memory**  
   - Store the last N logs or the most recent week’s changes in a high-performance index.
2. **Medium-Term Summaries**  
   - Summarize older logs into condensed “memory blocks,” merging recurring events or older solutions.
3. **Long-Term Archive**  
   - Keep full raw data in compressed archives. Retrieve / re-index only when absolutely necessary.

This prevents the system from drowning in old data. Summarization and archiving keep the system nimble while preserving the ability to revisit older knowledge when needed.

---

## **4. Automated Testing & CI/CD**

1. **Unit Tests + Integration Tests**  
   - Test each major function or pipeline (e.g., storing logs in the vector DB, retrieving them, feeding them to an LLM).
   - Ensure you have test coverage for each step of your recall and debugging workflows.

2. **Continuous Integration (CI)**  
   - Even as a solo dev, set up GitHub Actions or another CI tool to run tests automatically on each commit or pull request.
   - Catch breaking changes early (especially if you switch LLM or vector DB versions).

3. **System Health Checks**  
   - For a continuously running agent or service, have “health endpoints” or logs that confirm the vector DB is reachable, LLM calls are succeeding, etc.
   - This helps with early detection if a library update breaks something.

By baking in automated tests, you can confidently adopt new tools or approaches.

---

## **5. Stay Flexible with Model Choices**

Because LLM performance evolves rapidly:

1. **Support Both Local & Remote Models**
   - Use GPT-4 (API) or other cloud-based LLMs for advanced reasoning.
   - Keep an open-source local model in Docker as a fallback for quick tasks or offline scenarios.
   - Let the user (or config) choose which model to use for each job.

2. **Fine-Tuning or Instruction Tuning**
   - Keep logs and code snippets in an easily ingestible format so you can do a LoRA or full fine-tune if new open models become competitive.
   - This ensures you can benefit from future large open-source or specialized LLMs.

---

## **6. Composable Building Blocks**

Given that your interests are unorthodox, building small, composable modules is crucial for re-purposing them in creative ways:

- **Document Ingestion**: A module that reads any file or text source, transforms and indexes it.
- **Semantic Retrieval**: A module that finds relevant knowledge or logs from your DB.
- **Post-Processing**: Maybe a summarizer or code-generation step.
- **Workflow Orchestrator**: Ties tasks together (ingestion → retrieval → generation → action).

Keeping them discrete means you can combine them in unusual ways or apply them to new tasks (e.g. auto-indexing music metadata, archiving esoteric text, etc.) without rewriting the entire system.

---

## **7. Early MVP & Quick Passive Revenue**

While future-proofing is key, don’t over-engineer:

- Launch a **minimal, stable** product or sub-tool that solves a known pain point (e.g. “AI doc generator,” “PDF summarizer,” “Auto bug-fix recall for devs”).
- Gather real usage data; see which expansions people request.
- Use revenue or feedback to shape your next steps. Often, you’ll discover the real constraints and biggest needs only once you have real users.

Balancing “weird future expansions” with near-term monetization is essential.

---

## **8. Maintain a Living Roadmap**

- **Short-Term (Weeks/Months)**: The next tasks for building MVP, generating early revenue, refining the recall system.
- **Mid-Term (3–6 Months)**: Introduce advanced multi-agent or self-improvement loops, or expand to new data domains.
- **Long-Term (1–2 Years)**: Possibly host multiple specialized AI agents, integrate with bigger ecosystems, adopt new LLM breakthroughs.

Periodically update this roadmap. If a new model or major library emerges, see if it fits a short- or mid-term milestone. This ensures you adapt without discarding your entire architecture.

---

## **Summary**

By following these **eight** key guidelines, your AI Recall System can evolve gracefully:

1. **Design a layered architecture** (Data, Domain, Model, Presentation).  
2. **Abstract dependencies** and use open formats for logs & knowledge.  
3. **Plan for tiered memory** with summarization and archiving.  
4. **Automate testing & integrate CI** for stable, rapid iteration.  
5. **Stay flexible with model choices** (local vs. cloud).  
6. **Build composable building blocks** that you can mix and match for unorthodox workflows.  
7. **Deliver MVPs quickly** for near-term passive revenue, then expand.  
8. **Keep a living roadmap** so you can pivot to new breakthroughs with minimal friction.

Following these strategies ensures your **ai-recall** project remains valuable and adaptable, no matter how fast AI technology evolves.

# 🏗️ Technical Design Decisions

## **🔹 Why LM Studio for Model Execution?**

✅ **Lightweight and efficient for local LLM execution**  
✅ **Allows full control over model selection & usage**  
✅ **Runs models via Flask API for seamless agent integration**  
✅ **Avoids cloud-based API costs & licensing restrictions**  

## **🔹 Why Flask API as the Backend?**

✅ **Simple & efficient for serving local AI models**  
✅ **Integrates seamlessly with LM Studio**  
✅ **Works across Windows & WSL without network conflicts**  
✅ **Lightweight enough to maintain high-speed interactions**  

## **🔹 API Connectivity Handling**

Your system ensures **no connection refusals** by detecting the correct API endpoint:

```python
def detect_api_url(self):
    """Detect the correct API URL based on whether we are in WSL or native Windows."""
    wsl_ip = "172.17.128.1"
    default_url = "http://localhost:1234/v1/chat/completions"

    try:
        with open("/proc/version", "r") as f:
            if "microsoft" in f.read().lower():
                print(f"🔹 Detected WSL! Using Windows IP: {wsl_ip}")
                return f"http://{wsl_ip}:1234/v1/chat/completions"
    except FileNotFoundError:
        pass

    print(f"🔹 Using default API URL: {default_url}")
    return default_url

🚀 Ensures stable AI model interaction regardless of OS environment.**

🔹 AI Model Selection

🔥 Refining Model Selection – How Many Do We Need?
We need three categories of models to cover all use cases:

Category Purpose Model(s)
Primary Coder AI that writes, refactors, and debugs code deepseek-coder-33b-instruct ✅
General Reasoning Model Handles broader questions, logic-based reasoning, summarization, and context handling Recommended: Mistral-7B-Instruct or Yi-34B
Backup Small Model Lightweight, quick-response fallback when 33B is too heavy Recommended: deepseek-coder-6.7B or Yi-9B
📌 TL;DR: We should have at least 3 models running
1️⃣ Primary Code Model → deepseek-coder-33b-instruct (already in use)
2️⃣ General Knowledge Model → Mistral-7B-Instruct (best mix of size & reasoning ability)
3️⃣ Backup Small Model → deepseek-coder-6.7B (fast, good for quick tasks)

✅ Why Mistral-7B-Instruct?

Apache 2.0 Licensed (safe for commercial use)
Fast execution (lighter than 33B but still powerful for reasoning tasks)
Balanced general knowledge & context retention


🚀 We avoid Meta Llama 3 due to licensing issues.
🚀 Mixtral is currently unavailable due to tensor errors in LM Studio.

🔹 Why Continue.dev for AI-Powered Code Assistance?
✅ Integrates directly into VS Code
✅ Uses @codebase for AI-powered retrieval
✅ Enables real-time debugging & knowledge recall

🔹 Why ChromaDB for Vector Storage?
✅ Fast semantic search for AI-powered retrieval
✅ Local-first, but scalable to cloud if needed
✅ Easier to manage than Pinecone or Weaviate for a single-developer project

| **API Endpoints** | Query stored knowledge for external integrations. |

📌 **Example CLI Usage**

```bash
ai-recall "How did we solve API rate limiting?"
✅ Retrieves past solutions from ChromaDB

📌 Future AI-to-AI Workflow (Autonomous Queries)
📌 As the system evolves, AI will automatically handle recall & debugging.

Process Future AI Behavior
Self-Querying Past Work AI autonomously checks past debugging logs before proposing fixes.
Code Improvement Suggestions AI proactively recommends optimizations based on stored best practices.
Self-Triage of Issues AI detects errors and retrieves past solutions before executing a fix.
📌 Example AI Behavior (Future) 🚀 Instead of the developer typing:

bash
Copy
Edit
ai-debug "What was the last database error?"
✅ The AI will autonomously run the same query, fetch results, and apply a fix without human intervention.

📌 Continue.dev - AI-Assisted Coding in VS Code
📌 Currently, developers manually query AI for suggestions.
📌 Eventually, the AI will use Continue.dev APIs to self-optimize codebases.

Feature Current Use Future AI Behavior
@codebase Manually retrieve code snippets AI auto-searches relevant project files
@docs Pull documentation manually AI references docs before executing fixes
AI Chat Direct human interaction AI-to-AI querying for workflow automation
📌 Future AI Workflow Example 1️⃣ AI encounters an error in api_structure.py
2️⃣ AI queries debugging logs autonomously
3️⃣ AI retrieves and applies the previous fix
4️⃣ AI validates that the issue is resolved before deployment

✅ Reduces human intervention in debugging cycles.

📌 API-Assisted AI Interaction
📌 Currently, API endpoints allow external tools to interact with the AI Recall System.
📌 In the future, AI will self-query these endpoints automatically.

🔹 Query Stored Knowledge (/query/knowledge)
Method: POST
Example Request:

json
Copy
Edit
{
    "query": "What debugging steps were used for the last API failure?"
}
Example Response:

json
Copy
Edit
{
    "retrieved_knowledge": "The last API failure was related to a missing API key. Debugging steps included..."
}
✅ AI will eventually call this endpoint autonomously during error handling.

📌 Summary
📌 This document ensures developers can efficiently interact with AI for:
✅ Current Manual Workflows (CLI, Continue.dev, API queries)
✅ Future AI-to-AI Workflows (Autonomous debugging, self-querying memory)
✅ Seamless evolution from human-AI interaction to full AI-driven execution
